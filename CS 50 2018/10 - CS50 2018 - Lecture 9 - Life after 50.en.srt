[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,220
SPEAKER 1: All right, this is
CS50, and this is, sadly, the end,

3
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,550
where we wrap up the semester and take
a look back at the past several weeks,

4
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,966
give you a look at what's ahead
in the next several weeks,

5
00:01:00,966 --> 00:01:03,800
and then really the next several
years, how you can sort of go on,

6
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,150
beyond CS50, with the proverbial
training wheels now completely off.

7
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,840
And so that even without things
like CS50 IDE, and Check 50,

8
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,074
and Help 50, and other
such tools, you actually

9
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,240
feel like you can apply all of these
lessons learned, and all of these tools

10
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,770
you've experienced in CS50 to your
own Macs and PCs in the real world.

11
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,830
But I thought it would be perhaps
helpful or reassuring, especially

12
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,370
on the heels of so many problems sets,
some of them especially challenging,

13
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,910
and a recent quiz here on campus, to
just think back at this tenant here.

14
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:32,870
And we do mean this.

15
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,895
And realize if you're a
little uneasy as to what

16
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,770
remains in store for
the next few weeks, that

17
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,978
what ultimately matters in
this course is not so much

18
00:01:38,978 --> 00:01:40,890
where you end up relative
to your classmates,

19
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,170
but where you end up in week 10,
which is today, relative to yourself

20
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,610
in week zero, some 10 weeks ago.

21
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,930
So that was just a bold claim,
a pie in the sky back then.

22
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,110
But you've made it to this now
finish line, where all that remains

23
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,810
is that one final milestone,
where there's no specification.

24
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,160
You're not told what to do, but you
get to design and implement yourself.

25
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,620
And consider too, over
the past several weeks,

26
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,400
odds are many of you never really felt
like you got your footing, like ever.

27
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,610
Just as you started to grasp something,
we sort of pulled the rug out

28
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,390
from under you, or kind of asked you
to take another step up cognitively,

29
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,100
and actually understand something new.

30
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,851
Well, that's very much
the design of this.

31
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:19,724
I was trying to think
of metaphors yesterday.

32
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:22,310
And if you're into like weight
lifting or such, which I'm not,

33
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,110
I suppose the analog
here might be you're

34
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,470
sort of doing your weight
lifting and someone

35
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,170
keeps putting more and more weight on
the thing as you get better and better.

36
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,990
And so you never
actually necessarily feel

37
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,460
like you're making progress,
because it never gets any easier.

38
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,626
But that's just because the
weight on either end is,

39
00:02:37,626 --> 00:02:40,490
so I'm told, is getting
added to and added to.

40
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,040
And I do mean that more
academically here too,

41
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,960
is that with every
passing week, we start

42
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,560
to hope that you were reasonably
comfortable with what was in the past,

43
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,140
so that we could lead you
further along in that journey.

44
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,820
And perhaps most stark is the fact
that 10 weeks ago, many of you

45
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,160
probably found this difficult, right?

46
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,480
It's probably not all that distant
a memory how many minutes, or hours,

47
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,510
or a few days that it actually took
just to get Mario, so to speak--

48
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,220
and Mario's not even in the picture--

49
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,535
to just ascend this kind of
pyramid by using hashtags.

50
00:03:10,535 --> 00:03:12,650
And honestly, just a
week ago, did you all

51
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,980
build this, CS50 finance, which
had a back end implemented

52
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,040
in Python, generating
HTML and CSS dynamically,

53
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,260
that was talking to a
front end, that itself

54
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,770
was built with client-side languages,
like HTML, and CSS, and JavaScript,

55
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,910
talking meanwhile to an API, via HTTP,
that brought in data from a third party

56
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,690
source.

57
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,260
Like, that's where you now are.

58
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,890
And so even if you don't feel 100%
like you could build this from scratch,

59
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,090
and that's fine, indeed what many
students do for their final project is

60
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,834
start with something like P Set 8, tear
out all the finance specific stuff,

61
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:44,000
and then start to add their
own thoughts, and ideas,

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,630
and their own code, notice
just what the Delta truly is.

63
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,670
And that's what we mean by that
Delta between week zero and week 10.

64
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,430
I received, just this past
week, actually, an email

65
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,100
from one of your
classmates, who I thought

66
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,340
was wonderfully reflective on what
their experience had been like.

67
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,030
And quite consistent with this idea of
not quite ever getting their footing,

68
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,400
wrote this, "Besides
learning the new material,

69
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,040
I felt that I started to be
more comfortable with being

70
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,220
uncomfortable and being OK with
working towards building a skill,

71
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,863
rather than getting the right answer."

72
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:16,779
This is the kind of quote
that you kind of see

73
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:20,029
in like a Harvard brochure or whatnot,
but it's like, it really is true,

74
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:25,227
this idea of being comfortable being
uncomfortable is very much the case.

75
00:04:25,227 --> 00:04:28,310
And honestly, you're never really going
to get your footing in this world.

76
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,893
Because honestly, everything we
just taught this past semester

77
00:04:30,893 --> 00:04:33,840
is going to evolve, starting
tomorrow, and in the years to come.

78
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,673
But hopefully, what
we've done in the class,

79
00:04:35,673 --> 00:04:38,930
by choosing certain languages, some
of the most foundational, like C,

80
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,310
and SQL, and now Python, even as
those languages evolve themselves,

81
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,220
or become less used, the
principles of memory management,

82
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,610
and data structures, and tradeoffs,
and abstraction, and encapsulation, all

83
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,694
of those principles,
those aren't going away.

84
00:04:51,694 --> 00:04:54,860
And that's the advantage, I think, of
starting from the so-called ground up.

85
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,500
It wasn't that long ago we were
talking about zeros and ones.

86
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,140
So you're not just
software engineers, you're

87
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,662
computer scientists, or
budding computer scientists,

88
00:05:02,662 --> 00:05:04,370
because you have those
mental models that

89
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,090
can then be applied to any new
technologies or domains that

90
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,120
are down the road.

91
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,840
And if it's reassuring
too, even I feel this way.

92
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,467
Like, I don't feel like I've mastered
CS50 or all of the material therein.

93
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:17,300
I kind of feel like
that graph that we drew,

94
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,133
that was that green
curved line, where like,

95
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:21,410
fortunately, I'm always
making some forward progress,

96
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,694
but I'm never actually
reaching the peak of anything,

97
00:05:23,694 --> 00:05:25,610
because there's always
something new to learn.

98
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,540
And it's scary, too.

99
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,080
And, in fact, the most
relevant instance of being

100
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,150
comfortable being uncomfortable,
or maybe if in my case,

101
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,346
being uncomfortable being
uncomfortable, was just a few years ago.

102
00:05:36,346 --> 00:05:39,470
For many years, CS50 had used a language
called PHP for the web programming

103
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,386
portion of the course.

104
00:05:40,386 --> 00:05:43,280
And eventually, we as the staff,
decided it's time to transition

105
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,520
to Python, which has
a number of upsides.

106
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
Among them, the applicability
in the real world.

107
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,520
It can be used more
effectively for command line

108
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,730
programs, data science, data analytics,
and it just felt like it was time.

109
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,100
The one to catch was
I didn't know Python.

110
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,550
And so this sounded like a wonderful
idea, sort of philosophically,

111
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,130
that summer, yes, we shall
teach Python this fall.

112
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,050
Then October came
around, and I realized,

113
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,010
oh, Python's coming up in a week or
two, we should probably, we, meaning I,

114
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,690
should probably go learn Python.

115
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,910
And so that entire
semester, was I learning,

116
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,100
and we're repaving the road as we went.

117
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,100
And I swear, if you look back at the
videos from just a few years ago,

118
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,250
the Python lecture was like the
longest lecture ever we have.

119
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,250
Because I was so damn determined to
prove to everyone that I knew Python

120
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,500
by that point in the semester.

121
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,970
So perhaps overcompensating
a little bit.

122
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,070
But this is just to
reassure that none of us

123
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,410
even the smartest of your
teaching fellows and CAs, whom

124
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,826
you interacted with this year,
and myself, like none of us

125
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:36,000
ever stop learning or stop being a
little uncomfortable with this stuff.

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,280
So even if you feel like, wow, I didn't
quite absorb everything this semester,

127
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,370
you weren't ever going to,
because we never did either.

128
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,010
So take that to heart if you would.

129
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,570
Before we forge ahead-- oh, in
fact, I thought I'd mentioned to,

130
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,810
don't aspire to build this,
for instance, mirrored

131
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,091
backgrounds kind of went out of
vogue a long, long, long time ago.

132
00:06:57,091 --> 00:06:59,840
But this was the first example of
me building something, or trying

133
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,990
to solve a problem, that
I had no idea how to do.

134
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,452
CS50 at the time did not
teach web programming.

135
00:07:04,452 --> 00:07:06,410
CS51 at the time did not
teach web programming,

136
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,550
did not teach Perl, or CSV
files, or the kind of ingredients

137
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,280
I needed to build this, or
even HTML or CSS for that--

138
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,550
actually, there was no CSS
at that time, or even HTML.

139
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,680
And so for me, too, this
was an example of being

140
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,074
comfortable being uncomfortable, just
volunteering I will build the Frosh I

141
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:23,990
Am's website, and then
turning to my roommate,

142
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,537
and saying, how am I going to
build the Frosh I Am's website,

143
00:07:26,537 --> 00:07:28,370
and just getting
comfortable with that idea.

144
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,480
You'll figure it out.

145
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,050
And honestly, the key secret
is to just surround yourself

146
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,390
by really smart, smarter people,
who know way more than you,

147
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,800
who are more comfortable than you,
so you can stand on their shoulders

148
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,150
and learn from them along the way.

149
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,999
And indeed, allow me to thank,
before we forge ahead, just a few

150
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:47,040
of the folks that you've
either seen or not seen,

151
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,956
especially those behind
the scenes here today,

152
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:51,682
Mike, and Luke, and Jose, and
Tom, who, with media services,

153
00:07:51,682 --> 00:07:54,390
have helped us with all of this
amazing stuff over the past year.

154
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,190
CS50's production team, Dan and Tara,
and Ian, and Andrew, a couple of whom

155
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:58,940
are new this year.

156
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,520
And I know they were really
thrown into the fire.

157
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,100
You see one of them too, Max, the guy
who's creepily got a camera on his head

158
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,100
today here-- oh, OK, who
doesn't at the moment--

159
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,430
on our production team as
well, all helped capture this.

160
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,090
And you'll see too, even this world,
of videos influenced by software,

161
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,780
this other camera here, that's just
robotically been going back and forth,

162
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,920
left to right all semester, controlled
essentially by a PS4 controller,

163
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,170
via software and via a
Wi-Fi connection thereto.

164
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,640
So thank you to the team for making
possible so many of the experiences you

165
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,409
all have had here online.

166
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:35,750
And of course, there's
a whole bigger team

167
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,049
teaching the class, the CAs,
and the TFs, our preceptors,

168
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:42,409
and the heads of the class, without
whom I certainly could not do this.

169
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:44,789
These are all of their
names there, sandwiched in.

170
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:46,580
And perhaps if we could,
and we'll let them

171
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,930
know by playing the video
for them, such a round

172
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,680
of applause that they got here at
lecture is thanks for their time

173
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,445
with us this year.

174
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:53,090
If we could.

175
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,040
[APPLAUSE]

176
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,840
In particular, you might
have noticed the notes

177
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,850
that are on the course's
website, usually a couple of days

178
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:04,570
after the lecture.

179
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,361
And this is all thanks
to a former teaching

180
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:10,030
fellow, Cheng Gong, who graduated a
few years ago in computer science,

181
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:14,341
and has wonderfully continue to
watch the course's videos, just

182
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:16,840
a few hours, typically, after
they air, so as to provide you

183
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,381
with a canonical set of notes,
so that you're not yourselves,

184
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:21,380
heads down, scribbling everything down.

185
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,720
Cheng, therefore, is going to be hearing
and listening to these very words.

186
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,010
And therefore, I've been told to say
just what a wonderful person Chang

187
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:34,000
Gong is, and how we couldn't do
the course so well without him,

188
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,880
and we really forever appreciate
all of his contributions to CS50,

189
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,780
and he would make a wonderful addition
to any tech company out there.

190
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,730
So, thank you.

191
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,757
Thank you to Chang, as well.

192
00:09:47,757 --> 00:09:48,651
[APPLAUSE]

193
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,650
And allow me to call
out a couple of folks

194
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,820
in particular, two of our undergrads,
who among the most involved

195
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,320
in the course, behind the scenes
and in front of the scenes.

196
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,207
One of whom is in the process of
translating the course into Spanish

197
00:10:02,207 --> 00:10:05,040
with us, so that we can make it
available not only to students here,

198
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,070
but also natively to folks
elsewhere in the world for whom

199
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:11,467
English is a second, or
not even, a third language.

200
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:13,800
And therefore, the English
aspects of the class despite,

201
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,777
its being open courseware, are
just an unnecessary hurdle,

202
00:10:16,777 --> 00:10:19,110
in terms of the software, and
the content, and so forth.

203
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,151
And so, in fact, I thought
I'd give you a glimpse

204
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:26,160
of what CS50's own Veronica has
been doing over the past few months.

205
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,310
For instance, this is what
awaits students online soon,

206
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,840
as they, themselves, tackle, just as the
Myla helped us here in English, Mario,

207
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,530
for instance.

208
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:53,730
VERONICA: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

209
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,700
SPEAKER 1: My thanks to other folks
behind the scenes, some of whom

210
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,990
you might have met, Aaron, and Greg,
and Doug, and then one other member

211
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:06,000
of the course's heads, who sadly,
will be graduating this coming spring.

212
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,999
Brian Yu literally wandered
into my office a few years ago.

213
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:11,040
And we got to chatting
about whether he could get

214
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,990
involved in some form in the course.

215
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,290
And here now, three or so years
later, he spent January's with us,

216
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,540
summers here with us, and
pretty much runs the show now.

217
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,370
And honestly, of all of the head
teaching fellows we've had, all of them

218
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,640
are amazing, but there really is
something special about Brian Yu.

219
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,820
And honestly, in a word,
he is extraordinary.

220
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,340
And what I thought we'd do
is, as thanks to the staff,

221
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,820
and as an invitation to you all, to
consider applying to join us as a TF,

222
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,450
as a CA, as a photographer, as
a producer, any number of hats

223
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,110
that the team here wears, we filmed in
advance, thanks to CS50's production

224
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,510
team, and thanks CS50's own
Connor Doyle, and undergrad,

225
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:49,096
put together the following film that
Brian has beautifully introduced us to.

226
00:11:49,096 --> 00:11:51,720
And then we'll take a quick look
back at some of our volunteers

227
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,530
who have appeared here in lectures
past on stage, CS50 Puzzle Day

228
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,890
lunches, and more, as a bit of
reflection on where you've all

229
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,460
come this past year.

230
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,940
If we could dim the lights again.

231
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,892
[PIANO MUSIC]

232
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:39,360
[MUSIC PLAYING]

233
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,544
(SINGING) And it's an open door.

234
00:12:43,544 --> 00:12:48,264
And off [INAUDIBLE]

235
00:13:05,196 --> 00:13:06,192
[MUSIC PLAYING]

236
00:13:24,618 --> 00:13:29,598
(SINGING) Help me out, let me down.

237
00:13:29,598 --> 00:13:35,076
I could learn from you,
I could learn from you.

238
00:13:35,076 --> 00:13:40,554
Help me out, let me down.

239
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:44,040
I could learn from you.

240
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,028
I could learn from you.

241
00:13:50,627 --> 00:13:52,960
So if we could, a round of
applause again for the staff.

242
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,954
[APPLAUSE]

243
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,130
So let's take a quick
look back then at what

244
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,935
it meant to be 10 weeks ago, when we
tore, and I was actually just thinking,

245
00:14:05,935 --> 00:14:09,060
we probably should have added the meme
clip to that part of the video here,

246
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,393
we tore this phone book in
half and began our discussion

247
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:14,460
of computational thinking
and all things thereafter.

248
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,710
And what we hope to do
with this quick look,

249
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,320
is to just remind you just
how far, truly, you've come,

250
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,080
and to sort of remind how
hopefully a number of these topics

251
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,810
have all coincided and intermingled.

252
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,310
So this was computer science, right?

253
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,890
In week zero, we proposed this black
box, that we revealed to be algorithms.

254
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,380
And we had inputs and outputs.

255
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,000
We needed to represent those
inputs and outputs, and thus

256
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,690
were it was born zeros,
and ones, and binary.

257
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,300
And from there, did we talk
about higher level abstractions,

258
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,570
talking about how you might have decimal
or letters of the alphabet, ASCII

259
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,320
and Unicode, the number 65,
representing the same there,

260
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,170
the same pattern of bits might
represents something like a dot,

261
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,357
or a pixel of yellow.

262
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,440
If you have a whole bunch
of those dots or pixels,

263
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,360
you might have a crying face of joy.

264
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,360
And if you might have
multiple images like that,

265
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,800
you might have animojis
or videos, more generally,

266
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,530
which are just yet another
abstraction on top of that.

267
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,160
And so, as you go out into the
real world now, after CS50,

268
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,612
and see pretty fancy and
newfangled technologies,

269
00:15:07,612 --> 00:15:09,320
just start to critique
them in your mind.

270
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,580
And consider, well, I know
how this feature is done,

271
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,746
and I know how that feature
implements that feature.

272
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:17,070
Odds are, you can reverse
engineer in your mind how many

273
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,050
of today's technologies
work, just by building

274
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,967
backwards to those lower levels.

275
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:22,800
We then introduced
pseudo-codes, so we could

276
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,633
talk about what it meant
to express yourself

277
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,050
more carefully, more methodically.

278
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,341
And we introduced loops, and
conditions, and variables,

279
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:30,369
and other such tenants,
that we then translated,

280
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:31,660
eventually to another language.

281
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,590
And we also talked not about
correctness, but about efficiency.

282
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,920
So that you have a mental model of just
how good your code, or your algorithm,

283
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,927
or your thought ultimately is.

284
00:15:39,927 --> 00:15:41,760
And then was introduced
Scratch, so that you

285
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,190
had a way, albeit
graphically, to express

286
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,150
all of these various components,
by programming Scratch up and down,

287
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,440
and left and right.

288
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,419
Of course, things got pretty
scary, or ugly, pretty quickly.

289
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:55,710
We then transitioned to C, when all of
a sudden, the simplest of "Hello world,"

290
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,030
started to look like that.

291
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:00,030
Odds are, that first week, if
you'd never seen any programming

292
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,700
language before, let alone
C, most of those lines

293
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,020
did not look familiar, except
for perhaps the "Hello world,"

294
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,300
but even that thing was followed
by some random backslash n.

295
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,110
And all of that have we, hopefully,
teased apart over the past many weeks.

296
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,600
That, of course, gets compiled
down to zeros and ones,

297
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,100
which the computer only understands.

298
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,016
And thankfully, we humans
live in an age where

299
00:16:19,016 --> 00:16:21,840
we don't need to worry about
that level, or relatively few

300
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,910
of us do, because we have
abstractions, and libraries,

301
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,580
and other developments on top.

302
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:31,140
In week two, did we then introduce
other aspects of programming,

303
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,167
and functions, and return
values, and the like.

304
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:36,000
And we also talked about what's
really going on underneath the hood.

305
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,640
Code, like this here, for
instance, gets compiled often

306
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,080
into multiple files, CS50s,
standard iOS and your own code,

307
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,855
and then they all get linked together.

308
00:16:44,855 --> 00:16:46,980
But there too, that's what
you're getting for free,

309
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,730
so to speak, by running a
compiler like Clang, albeit again

310
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,950
and again, whenever you
make a change to your code.

311
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,200
We introduced the notion of
memory, a little chip that

312
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,170
might be in your computer.

313
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,020
And if we zoom in on
that, it really is just

314
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:02,190
this beautiful, simple canvas
of bytes, top to bottom,

315
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,440
left to right, that you can
do anything you want with.

316
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,190
Like that is it.

317
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,650
Despite all of the seeming
complexity of a computer,

318
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,410
that is the canvas that
you have to work with.

319
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:13,829
And that was allowing us to do
any number of the data structures

320
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,040
and algorithms on top of it.

321
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,250
For instance, in week three,
we talked about strings.

322
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,940
And strings were very straightforward.

323
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,829
You might not have
heard the word initially

324
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:23,579
in the context of programming,
but just a sequence of characters,

325
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,619
like a word, a phrase,
a sentence, or such.

326
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,160
And then things got scary
again quickly, when we said,

327
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,470
those are a little bit of a
white lie, and abstraction,

328
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,260
more properly, on top of pointers.

329
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,290
Of course, pointers themselves
got a little scary quickly.

330
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:40,374
And even in retrospect,
this might still look scary.

331
00:17:40,374 --> 00:17:41,040
And that's fine.

332
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:46,110
The reality most of you will not
have occasion to program in C again.

333
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,649
The only occasions I have are generally
in September and October of every year,

334
00:17:49,649 --> 00:17:52,440
myself, because in the real world,
I tend not to use this language,

335
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,750
though it does remain super
popular and super commonly used,

336
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,290
especially in hardware based
contexts, where you really

337
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,124
want to squeeze as much performance
as possible out of the hardware,

338
00:18:01,124 --> 00:18:04,081
and you don't necessarily want the
overhead of a higher level language,

339
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:04,620
like Python.

340
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,750
But what's important is
just those principles.

341
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,020
The fact that you can put things
in memory, you can go there,

342
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,040
you can move them.

343
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,557
That's all this crazy syntax
has been doing for us.

344
00:18:13,557 --> 00:18:16,140
Of course, it didn't end well
for Binky, when you abused this.

345
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,450
And indeed a lot of today's
programming errors, even

346
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:22,680
ones that are still with us today,
reduce to misusing or accidentally

347
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,090
touching memory that you should not.

348
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:28,860
But once you have that primitive,
this ability to stitch things together

349
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,190
in memory, then you can start
to build things in software.

350
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:36,240
We introduced Structs, in C, which allow
us to come up with our own custom data

351
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,199
types that have multiple
things inside of them.

352
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:40,114
And once you have that,
if one of those things

353
00:18:40,114 --> 00:18:42,270
is itself a pointer
to something else, you

354
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,760
can kind of string things
together in memory,

355
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,730
thereby giving you access to linked
lists, which solve problems when

356
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,370
it comes to the limitations of arrays.

357
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,300
And you can do even fancier things like
hash tables, that might conceptually

358
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,670
and pictorial look like
this, or even the crazier

359
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,320
tri, which theoretically,
is even more efficient,

360
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,450
it just takes up so much more space.

361
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,320
But that's it.

362
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,221
With pointers, all you're doing
is stitching these data structures

363
00:19:05,221 --> 00:19:05,720
together.

364
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,645
And even though most languages on top
of C, like Python, and Java, and PHP,

365
00:19:09,645 --> 00:19:12,130
and Ruby, don't have
pointers per se, they

366
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,650
have the idea of addresses
or references still.

367
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:18,082
So the concept is there, they've
just made it a little easier

368
00:19:18,082 --> 00:19:21,040
not to shoot yourself in the foot by
making mistakes and getting things

369
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,680
like seg fault. The compilers
and the interpreters

370
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,660
are increasingly getting good at helping
you protect yourself from human error.

371
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,470
And then, thereafter, we began to
transition, felt like a long time in C,

372
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,890
but we began to talk about HTTP,
and virtual envelopes and messages,

373
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,995
just going from point A to point B.
And among those things were headers.

374
00:19:38,995 --> 00:19:42,010
And you'll recall, perhaps
among the more amusing headers,

375
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,920
was this one, bought some years ago.

376
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,580
If you use a browser or if you use
Curl, like a program at the command

377
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,180
line, and the IDE, or your Mac or
PC, and you actually request this,

378
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,690
what was the status code that came back?

379
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:56,915
Anyone recall?

380
00:19:56,915 --> 00:19:57,790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

381
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,288
SPEAKER 1: Wasn't 200, wasn't 404.

382
00:20:00,288 --> 00:20:01,284
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

383
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,450
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, it was
like permanently redirected.

384
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,732
I think 301 or 302 came back,
and where did it lead to?

385
00:20:07,732 --> 00:20:08,906
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

386
00:20:08,906 --> 00:20:10,030
SPEAKER 1: Yale University.

387
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,180
So that was nice and fun.

388
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,321
Of course, they bought
HarvardSucks.org some time ago.

389
00:20:15,321 --> 00:20:17,070
And for those unfamiliar,
this weekend is,

390
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,380
of course, the Harvard-Yale football
game, here in Cambridge this year.

391
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,880
So as clever as Yale has been for
like a decade of paying annually

392
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,320
for, or rather as clever as we
have been, whoever the alum,

393
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,560
is paying for a decade
for Safetyschool.org

394
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:37,054
redirecting to Yale.edu, unfortunately,
HarvardSucks.org also lives on.

395
00:20:37,054 --> 00:20:39,220
In fact, there's a whole
wonderful back story there,

396
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,700
that was about 12-plus years ago now.

397
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,290
Where some enterprising students
at Yale kind of really got us.

398
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,580
Have folks seen or heard this story?

399
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,220
So we really embarrassed
ourselves some years ago.

400
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,310
And it will all boil down to some
very enterprising Yale students

401
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:56,010
using a little bit of software
and a computer program

402
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:00,600
to create an actual bitmap, like
a grid of pixels using humans.

403
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,440
The problem was that those humans
were us, on the Harvard side,

404
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,970
in the Harvard stadium.

405
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:10,779
Because we essentially created a bitmap
message, thanks to their cleverness.

406
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:13,320
So I thought we'd dim the lights
and for about three minutes,

407
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,210
look at just how bad they got us.

408
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,699
Now to be fair, we got them for like
12 years, or 19 years of football

409
00:21:18,699 --> 00:21:21,490
thereafter, though they have been
winning the past couple of years.

410
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,620
So we can't really talk about this now.

411
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:30,760
So without further ado, let's dim
the lights and pull this look up too.

412
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,750
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

413
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:39,485
- We're headed up to Boston,
checking out the stadium for a prank.

414
00:21:39,485 --> 00:21:42,220
- A few years ago, I was
at a math conference.

415
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,410
And I was sitting around
at the table at dinner,

416
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,990
with a few other mathematicians.

417
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:50,530
And one of them went
to Harvard, and started

418
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:55,690
telling the story of this amazing
prank that was against Harvard.

419
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,030
And at that point, I
felt I had to interrupt,

420
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:02,360
and said, well, actually I can
tell you a lot more about that.

421
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:02,961
- OK.

422
00:22:02,961 --> 00:22:03,460
- OK.

423
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,710
- The idea was perfected in a dorm room.

424
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,140
- We came up with the idea,
actually, to prank them

425
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,950
with signs at the football game.

426
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,480
We threw some ideas out there as
far as what the signs would say.

427
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,150
We eventually settled on "We Suck."

428
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,240
and my immediate reaction
was, no, this will never work.

429
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,380
However, the problem solver in me
started thinking, well, maybe we

430
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,870
can make this work.

431
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:30,640
- The problem, they had to infiltrate
Harvard stadium without getting caught,

432
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,310
sneak in 1,800 placards, distribute
them to unsuspecting Harvard fans,

433
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:38,820
and then convince those
fans to prank themselves.

434
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,690
- That's great.

435
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:44,520
- We thought about basically every
possible thing that could go wrong

436
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,640
and tried to come up
with a solution for it.

437
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,380
- And then you put
two guys on top of it.

438
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:55,270
- They made fake Harvard IDs and fake
backstories, fake placard designs,

439
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:58,240
and a 28-member fake pep squad.

440
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,430
On November 20th, 2004,
the fake Harvard students

441
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:05,218
smuggled the placards into the game.

442
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:06,655
- What do you think of Yale, sir?

443
00:23:06,655 --> 00:23:07,613
- They suck.

444
00:23:11,445 --> 00:23:14,810
- It's not going to say
something like Yale sucks, is it?

445
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,390
- It says go Harvard.

446
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,560
- But then, trouble.

447
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,246
- What houses are you guys in?

448
00:23:23,246 --> 00:23:25,191
- That's not a real house.

449
00:23:25,191 --> 00:23:25,691
- Ho-fo?

450
00:23:25,691 --> 00:23:26,669
- Yeah.

451
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:29,467
- You guys aren't from Harvard, are you?

452
00:23:29,467 --> 00:23:32,550
- Can I see your Harvard ID because I
really think you guys are from Yale.

453
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,740
- I just showed him
the front of this ID,

454
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,940
and all the sudden, he just ran
away, and he felt so embarrassed.

455
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,020
- Having escaped one confrontation,
they couldn't risk another.

456
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,050
It was time.

457
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,390
- This just looks like a total mess.

458
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,874
- We have absolutely no idea
if this is going to work.

459
00:23:50,874 --> 00:23:53,371
- Look at them, they have the paper.

460
00:23:53,371 --> 00:23:55,610
It's actually going to happen.

461
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,810
I can't [BEEP] believe this.

462
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:04,082
- What was once a
prank, became a legend.

463
00:24:04,082 --> 00:24:04,582
- We did it.

464
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,480
- And immediately, we started
hearing chants from the other side.

465
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,507
You suck.

466
00:24:12,507 --> 00:24:15,250
- You suck, you suck, you suck.

467
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:19,328
- And I think it was at that point in
time that we knew we had pulled it off.

468
00:24:19,328 --> 00:24:22,858
- One more time.

469
00:24:22,858 --> 00:24:23,774
- There it goes again.

470
00:24:27,624 --> 00:24:29,540
- I really think it
didn't matter that Harvard

471
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:34,694
won, because of the prank for a
lot of Yale students and alumni,

472
00:24:34,694 --> 00:24:35,860
we definitely won that year.

473
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,856
[END PLAYBACK]

474
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,750
SPEAKER 1: So there you go problem
solving at Harvard, Yale as well.

475
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,140
All right, the bar has been set.

476
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,260
So thereafter, let's try to
somehow make this more academic

477
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:55,965
again, so thereafter, did we transition
from looking at the principles of HTTP,

478
00:24:55,965 --> 00:24:58,090
and the envelopes with
which you can send messages,

479
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,470
and actually introduced
a language with which

480
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,200
we can create user interfaces
and things far more interesting

481
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,570
than terminal windows alone.

482
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,070
Of course, there was a connection
even to the material past,

483
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,111
because underneath the
hood, what your browser is

484
00:25:08,111 --> 00:25:10,630
doing is reading that HTML,
top to bottom, left to right,

485
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,730
and building really a
tree structure in memory,

486
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:16,210
that you can then manipulate using
JavaScript, yet another language.

487
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,810
And then in week six, did
we tragically point out

488
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,690
that all that complexity we'd
wrestled with just a few weeks ago,

489
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,320
trying to build a linked list with null
at the end and pointers throughout,

490
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,010
actually reduces to just this in
Python, just a single line of code.

491
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,410
And then this amazing data
structure that theoretically

492
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,399
has constant time access
and dynamic growth,

493
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,190
because you can chain
everything off of it.

494
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:39,490
You just have to write a lot of code
to do all the memory management,

495
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,200
is just this in Python.

496
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,970
But underneath the hood,
that is what Python is doing.

497
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:47,350
In fact, a lot of the Python
interpreter, the program called Python,

498
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:51,100
is itself written in C. And so
someone, just thankfully not you,

499
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,140
has had to write all
of that functionality.

500
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,030
But Python itself is
just an abstraction.

501
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,630
These functions are abstractions on
top of these lower level implementation

502
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:59,320
details.

503
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,850
And that should really become
part of your vocabulary,

504
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:04,900
distinguishing between design,
and abstractions, and lower level

505
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,370
implementation details,
all of which are important,

506
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,579
but they don't all need to
be at the tip of your mind

507
00:26:09,579 --> 00:26:11,661
when you're thinking about
how to solve a problem.

508
00:26:11,661 --> 00:26:13,220
You can solve problems at this level.

509
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,975
And then lower down into
the implementation details.

510
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:18,100
So after that, we tried to
tie everything together.

511
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,100
And we looked more generally
at web programming.

512
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,340
We just looked at one paradigm of
web programming, the MVC model,

513
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:24,910
so to speak.

514
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,400
There are dozens,
probably more these days,

515
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,470
all of them with fancy
confusing acronyms.

516
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,660
But it's just different
ways to solve problem.

517
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,670
Because we humans,
with each passing year,

518
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:36,640
realize that, hey, I, in my
company, and you, in your company,

519
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,400
and you, in your dorm, we're all
trying to solve similar ideas.

520
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,510
We're all trying to make an app.

521
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,968
We're all trying to make a website.

522
00:26:41,968 --> 00:26:43,540
And we're all reinventing wheels.

523
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,540
And so new frameworks are invented,
and new methodologies, and people

524
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,470
start sharing.

525
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:50,860
And the world starts to collaborate
by way of open source tools,

526
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:54,340
that we, ourselves, have used, like
Flask being one such example thereof,

527
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,220
jQuery a little bit, Bootstrap
as well, all of which

528
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,440
allow us to sort of solve
problems collectively

529
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,770
and get real, more interesting work
done without having to deal with all

530
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,960
of those implementation details.

531
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,742
And then lastly, did we
introduce one last language, SQL,

532
00:27:07,742 --> 00:27:09,700
which gave us all the
more of a back end, where

533
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,980
we can store stuff, a
lot more stuff, and a lot

534
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,380
more easily than we
could with CSVs alone.

535
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,965
And if you like this world of
statistics, and data science,

536
00:27:16,965 --> 00:27:19,840
and the like, or if you're going
back to the world of the humanities,

537
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,090
or medicine, or any number of fields,
where there's just lots of words,

538
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:26,740
lots of books, lots of texts,
lots of data, ultimately, SQL,

539
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,100
and all of these languages can be
used to help you answer questions

540
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,540
that you might have in those domains.

541
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,450
So from there, where do we go?

542
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:40,530
So after Thanksgiving break here
in Cambridge is the CS50 hackathon.

543
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,750
It will begin at 7:00 PM in the
evening, and it will end at 7:00 AM

544
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,560
the next night.

545
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,650
And it's meant to be one of those
uniquely collegiate experiences, where

546
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:50,650
you have alongside you all of
your friends and classmates,

547
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:54,340
and all of the course's staff into
the night, working on final projects.

548
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,810
An opportunity to be productive.

549
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:59,020
An opportunity far enough away from
the deadline to feel good about it

550
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,680
and to take breaks, and to
have dinner with us at 9:00 PM,

551
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,789
to have second dinner
with us around 1:00 AM.

552
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:06,580
And then if you're
still awake, around 5:00

553
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,340
AM we charter some Harvard
shuttles, and take ourselves

554
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,100
to IHOP for breakfast as well.

555
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,530
But you're welcome to go to
sleep at any point in between.

556
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:16,321
Just to give you a
sense of what it's like.

557
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:18,760
On arrival, the students
from both Harvard and Yale

558
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,270
ascend the stairs, joining the staff
for the evening of programming.

559
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:25,750
We have reserved the entire
space above the Innovation Lab

560
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,770
across the river at
HBS, where everyone will

561
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,612
be able to tuck themselves away
into a corner with their partners,

562
00:28:30,612 --> 00:28:32,320
or with their friends,
or classmates more

563
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,260
generally, and just work throughout
the night on their final projects.

564
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,660
There's a photo booth,
and a Myla as well,

565
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,460
as well as other members of the staff.

566
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,700
There are therapy dogs in some years,
if you'd like to take a little break

567
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,430
and meet such puppies as these.

568
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,410
And then, of course,
at 5:00 AM, is IHOP.

569
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,840
And this is Maria
Zlatkova, now at Facebook,

570
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,150
greeting us at last year's breakfast.

571
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,440
And then the CS50 fair.

572
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,910
On both campuses is this event.

573
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,740
An opportunity for
all of you to show off

574
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,010
just what you accomplish
this semester, truly meant

575
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:02,010
to be the capstone of what you've
done, not exhibiting your own problems

576
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:05,470
sets that you were told how to build,
but your own project that you yourself

577
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,510
decided how to.

578
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:10,150
We'll invite the entire campus,
the faculty, students, and staff

579
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,080
from across campus.

580
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,009
Usually it's about 2,000-plus people.

581
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:15,550
We'll be in the beautifully
renovated Smith Center this year,

582
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,610
right in Harvard Square.

583
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:20,110
So we expect to have quite a few
passers by and tourists as well.

584
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:23,410
It's always coupled with
a fabulous raffle, whereby

585
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,080
you'll all be given, as student
presenters, little smiley face

586
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,870
stickers or such.

587
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:29,380
Anyone who chats you up and
asks you about your project

588
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,382
and for a quick demo on
your laptop or phone,

589
00:29:31,382 --> 00:29:34,090
you'll be able to hand them a
sticker and be eligible, therefore,

590
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,140
for fabulous prizes.

591
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,630
Along the way though, there'll
be popcorn, and snacks,

592
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,632
and music, and more.

593
00:29:38,632 --> 00:29:40,590
Some of our alumni from
industry to talk to you

594
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:44,010
about the real world, and summer time,
and full-time opportunities as well.

595
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:47,250
And what you'll see is a space
that looks, and feels, and sounds,

596
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,620
rather like this, with
folks just mingling around,

597
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:53,970
really proud and happy to see what it
is that you and your friends pulled off.

598
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:57,570
With popcorn in attendance, stress balls
in attendance, and staff, and students

599
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:00,810
alike, hopefully delighting
in what it is that you did.

600
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:04,782
Everyone will end the semester
with a I took CS50 t-shirt.

601
00:30:04,782 --> 00:30:06,990
Hopefully, this is something
you two will wear proud.

602
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:09,340
In fact, this truly is
where I got my start.

603
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,730
1996, CS50 changed my life.

604
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:16,650
And, in fact-- in fact,
here, is indeed proof

605
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:20,920
of just how proud I am to have actually
gotten my way through this course

606
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:25,350
so long ago, when I, myself, had not had
the nerve freshman year even to shop.

607
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:29,010
So hopefully, you feel yourselves
a member of that community as well.

608
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:33,270
So of course, we thought we'd give you
a sense of what the next few weeks might

609
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:36,810
be like, especially if you don't
necessarily budget your time properly.

610
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,000
A few years ago, we used
before the CS50 IDE,

611
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,434
the software called
CS59 Appliance, which

612
00:30:41,434 --> 00:30:43,850
was like a downloadable version
of it for your Mac and PC.

613
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,683
It tended to be a little slower,
and you'll see an allusion to that.

614
00:30:46,683 --> 00:30:49,710
But this video produced by CS50's
production team, and particularly

615
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:52,980
Dan Coffee, was CS50's first
experimentation with puppetry.

616
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,110
And you'll see that we
tell the story by proxy

617
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:59,667
of a CS50 student working on their final
project, just as the deadline nears.

618
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:01,500
And so if we could dim
the lights, this will

619
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:06,840
be our last of the videos for today
before we now look ahead at the years

620
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,288
after.

621
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,286
[PHONE RINGING]

622
00:31:20,763 --> 00:31:21,761
[MUSIC PLAYING

623
00:31:21,761 --> 00:33:56,080
- "MISSION IMPOSSIBLE"]

624
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,060
So our thanks to Dan Coffee
and the team for producing that

625
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,553
as well, if we could.

626
00:34:00,553 --> 00:34:01,499
[APPLAUSE]

627
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,810
That is indeed exactly
how deadlines work.

628
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:12,889
Every time we have a deadline, I--

629
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:14,130
So life after 50.

630
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:17,060
So the training wheels are off,
you can keep the rubber duck

631
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,550
and have someone to talk to
as you wrestle with problems.

632
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,779
But the CS50 IDE, while
you can keep using it,

633
00:34:21,779 --> 00:34:25,070
it's not something you, odds are, going
to use in the real world for very long.

634
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:28,386
And there really is no check 50
and help 50 in the real world,

635
00:34:28,386 --> 00:34:29,719
though there are lots of humans.

636
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,677
They are not called TFs anymore,
they're called friends and colleagues.

637
00:34:32,677 --> 00:34:35,109
But you can lean on those folks as well.

638
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:37,299
And what we thought we'd
give you is some list

639
00:34:37,299 --> 00:34:40,340
of suggestions for next steps, so that
you feel like there's offboarding.

640
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,870
And honestly, some of
this will happen naturally

641
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,328
as you tackle your final
projects, depending on the nature.

642
00:34:44,328 --> 00:34:47,900
And if you take another class, or CS50
beyond this winter, or you experience

643
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,000
these things yourselves, but we
thought we'd at least give you

644
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,560
some links in today's
slides, so that you

645
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,268
have something to tinker with over
Thanksgiving, or winter break,

646
00:34:54,268 --> 00:34:54,770
or beyond.

647
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:58,429
So CS50 IDE is meant to be
representative of a very

648
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,720
common programming environment.

649
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,420
It happens to be web based, it
happens to be in our domain name.

650
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,210
But this idea of having a
file browser of some sort,

651
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,700
and tabs where you write
code, and a terminal window

652
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,550
with which you interact,
incredibly, incredibly, common,

653
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:13,400
whether it's in the cloud, or
more commonly for real world

654
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,460
software developers on
your own Mac or your PC.

655
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,180
Frankly, some years from now, this will
probably be the way it is, none of us

656
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:23,362
use our Mac, PCs per se,
everything probably is remotely.

657
00:35:23,362 --> 00:35:26,070
So odds are, at some point in the
future, we'll come full circle.

658
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,278
But for now, it's quite
common to replicate this kind

659
00:35:28,278 --> 00:35:30,172
of setup on your own Mac or PC.

660
00:35:30,172 --> 00:35:33,380
So how do you go about having a command
line, which hopefully you've gleaned,

661
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,900
while frustrating, is more
powerful than only having

662
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,210
menus and icons available
to you that someone else,

663
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,670
like a company, like Microsoft
or Apple has given you.

664
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:44,570
Well, in both Macs and PCs,
can you install the same tools

665
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:47,300
that we used this
semester, Clang, and Make,

666
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,870
and you get CD, and LS, and
[? Miktor, ?] and all of those commands

667
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,190
on both Mac OS or Windows.

668
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,847
And the starting points can be here.

669
00:35:53,847 --> 00:35:56,930
Both of those provide their own sort
of terminal windows, and the software

670
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:57,790
therein.

671
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:00,939
You can just install via
those two starting points.

672
00:36:00,939 --> 00:36:01,730
Now what about Git?

673
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,800
You've seen or heard
about Git, even though we

674
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,774
don't use it hands on in the class.

675
00:36:05,774 --> 00:36:08,690
Odds are you will use this in higher
level CS courses, if you take it.

676
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:11,630
It's one of the most
popular programs with which

677
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,514
to save versions of your software.

678
00:36:13,514 --> 00:36:16,430
Now you may have noticed the CS50
IDE does this automatically for you.

679
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,800
You can go to File, Revision
History, and you can kind of

680
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,880
go back and forth in time.

681
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,610
And that's great and wonderfully useful,
but it doesn't really lend itself

682
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,090
to collaborating with others.

683
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,870
And so, if you're working with
partners for the final project,

684
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,953
in the simplest form, you
can just have one of you

685
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,259
share your CS50 IDE with
the other user names.

686
00:36:31,259 --> 00:36:33,050
And you'll all just
share the same account.

687
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,010
And that's fine.

688
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,976
But it gets a little
annoying and complicated

689
00:36:35,976 --> 00:36:37,850
if you're both trying
to edit the same files,

690
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:40,810
you're not necessarily talking to one
another, or you're in different rooms.

691
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:43,020
Like, at some point you
want to have good workflows.

692
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:47,390
And so via this URL here, does Brian
introduce you to Git, a command line

693
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:50,540
tool that's super, super, super
popular these days, that lets

694
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,190
you save versions of your code.

695
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:56,150
So you no longer call it
Mario 1.C, and Mario 2.C,

696
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,790
and Mario 3 AM.C and the like.

697
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,770
You actually call it Mario.C.

698
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:03,800
But you let Git take care of
time-stamping it and versioning it

699
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,460
for you.

700
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,710
And Git allows you to share
your code in the cloud.

701
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:10,160
What we use GitHub for is for,
of course, submissions, and such,

702
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,060
and for commenting.

703
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,980
But more generally, it's
used for just storing

704
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,720
code and sharing with other people.

705
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,730
So what you'll do with
Git is literally Git

706
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:20,570
push it to a service like a
GitHub, or GitLabs, or others.

707
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:23,859
Where someone else can then Git
pull it onto their own Mac or PC.

708
00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:25,400
And, therefore, you're sharing files.

709
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:25,940
You don't email.

710
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,231
You don't Dropbox, or the like.

711
00:37:27,231 --> 00:37:29,210
You actually use a
standardized software tool.

712
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,800
You can install it
via these instructions

713
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,270
here, if you don't have it already.

714
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:36,260
And more usefully too, can you
sign up for free repositories

715
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,060
GitHub.com, you already have an account.

716
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,400
Since you have a student
ID, you can go to this URL

717
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,370
here and tell them you're a student
at Harvard, or Yale, or beyond.

718
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,040
And then say, can I please
have free private repos,

719
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,620
so you can keep your own personal
or school projects private,

720
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,720
without needing access to
CS50's own organization.

721
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,130
So what do you write code in?

722
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,980
So, there's bunches
of editors these days.

723
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,570
Among the most popular
is a tools that's called

724
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,700
Atom, which is an open
source text editor that

725
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,039
has lots and lots of plug-ins.

726
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:02,080
This is like the tabbed
windows for writing code.

727
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,490
It does syntax, highlighting,
and so much more,

728
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,190
so that your code is easy to
edit, and it looks pretty wild

729
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,740
you're working on it, and
just makes life pretty easy.

730
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:13,486
Also super popular these days is
VS Code or Visual Studio Code.

731
00:38:13,486 --> 00:38:15,360
They are functionally
pretty much equivalent.

732
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,943
You can ask your teaching fellows
or friends which you prefer,

733
00:38:17,943 --> 00:38:19,070
or just try them both.

734
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,350
They are free, and there's
dozens of other options.

735
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:25,040
These two just currently have
a lot of momentum in industry.

736
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,760
Within the terminal window, though, is
what a lot of CS students would use,

737
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,669
something called Vim.

738
00:38:29,669 --> 00:38:32,460
And there's alternatives there,
called [? Emax ?] and a few others.

739
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,390
But Vim is actually what I grew up
on, and still to this day tend to use.

740
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,389
I tend not to use a GUI.

741
00:38:36,389 --> 00:38:39,876
I just use a bigger terminal window
with lots and lots of code inside of it.

742
00:38:39,876 --> 00:38:41,750
And Vim is more of a
command line tool, where

743
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:44,630
you have to memorize
keyboard shortcuts more so,

744
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,670
but it's also more
powerful in the same way

745
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,840
a terminal window tends to be as well.

746
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,121
So whatever you are most
comfortable with is fine.

747
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:53,870
So suppose you want to post a
website, like your own personal home

748
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:56,930
page, your resume, an artistic
portfolio, or whatnot,

749
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,100
where do you even begin?

750
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,370
You can certainly make it on
your Mac or PC in an HTML file,

751
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,210
but no one in the world can access it.

752
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,144
You can put it in CS50
IDE, but that goes

753
00:39:05,144 --> 00:39:07,060
to sleep eventually,
when you're not using it,

754
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,750
which makes it hard for people on
the internet to visited at any hour.

755
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,150
But fortunately, there's so
many free services out there,

756
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,950
at least if you have modest usage.

757
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,270
If you're trying to
build a business, odds

758
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,061
are you're going to pay someone
for the bandwidth, and the support,

759
00:39:18,061 --> 00:39:18,640
and so forth.

760
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,889
But if you just have a home page, where
you're getting dozens, hundreds, maybe

761
00:39:21,889 --> 00:39:23,790
low thousands of visits,
which is probably

762
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,800
likely the case for
personal sites, you can

763
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,640
use something called GitHub Pages, a
free service where you store your HTML

764
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,430
files, JavaScript,
and CSS on GitHub.com,

765
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,720
and they host it for you for free.

766
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,280
Netlify is another free
one too, and dot, dot, dot,

767
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,520
you can Google ad nauseam and find
any number of free such services.

768
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,600
These just tend to be two popular
ones with which I too am familiar.

769
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,049
Hosting a web app, so not a static
website, but something more dynamic,

770
00:39:49,049 --> 00:39:51,840
we'll have instructions that we'll
circulate for this final project

771
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,750
as well, so that you can sort
of graduate from CS50 IDE

772
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,120
and run your final
project, or your website,

773
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:01,290
or your student group's tool,
or your startup's website

774
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,580
on a third-party service.

775
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,399
Heroku tends to be very popular.

776
00:40:04,399 --> 00:40:05,940
They too have a free tier of service.

777
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,640
So long as your website's not being
hammered by lots and lots of users,

778
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,400
you can use it for free.

779
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,274
You get free access to a database,
something called Post [? Gress, ?]

780
00:40:12,274 --> 00:40:14,130
which we alluded to
earlier in the semester,

781
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:16,020
using the same data types we discussed.

782
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:19,500
Wix is another common one too, that very
recently launched support for code, not

783
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,030
just static web sites too.

784
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,530
So these are starting points.

785
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:26,050
But certainly use Google or the
like to find other options as well.

786
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,380
Then there's infrastructure,
as a service, so to speak.

787
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,680
There's some bigger fish out there,
Amazon, and Microsoft, and Google,

788
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,000
that have cloud-based services.

789
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,220
The learning curve tends to
be a little higher, frankly.

790
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,860
So I would encourage you to maybe
start with the previous examples, which

791
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,780
are businesses built
on top of these layers.

792
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,394
But if you're interested,
absolutely sign up

793
00:40:42,394 --> 00:40:44,310
as a student for any
number of these services,

794
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:46,170
and they tend to give you
lots of financial credits,

795
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:48,419
so you can just try things
for free, for like a month,

796
00:40:48,419 --> 00:40:50,730
or a year, or whatnot
to get your feet wet.

797
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:53,010
It's a wonderfully free
world when you're just

798
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:54,830
getting started in this space.

799
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,170
And then more general advice.

800
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:56,700
Read lots.

801
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,350
And I'm sure if you ask
the TFs and CAs, you'll

802
00:40:58,350 --> 00:40:59,814
get an even longer list of sites.

803
00:40:59,814 --> 00:41:02,730
But these tend to be the kinds of
sites I go to if I just kind of want

804
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,530
to stay in the loop on things.

805
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,580
Subscribing to various
sub-Reddits, so to speak,

806
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,205
is compelling, where information, news,
conversations, just get pushed at you.

807
00:41:10,205 --> 00:41:12,330
And honestly, whenever I'm
asked how I kind of stay

808
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:15,120
in touch with certain things,
I hear things from friends,

809
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,499
I get emails about technologies, I
get curious, and so I poke around.

810
00:41:18,499 --> 00:41:21,540
And these tend to be the places that
I might go, and a lot of tech people

811
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,300
go, to talk about new
trends and technologies.

812
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,600
Or if you're trying to vet something,
should I use x or should I use y,

813
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,650
don't just use Google.

814
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:30,764
Check out those websites as well.

815
00:41:30,764 --> 00:41:32,680
And then CS50, if you'd
like to stay in touch.

816
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,910
So CS50, not so much here on campus,
but for students around the world,

817
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,460
maintains a number of online
communities, all of which

818
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:42,300
you're welcome to partake in, answering
questions, or asking questions,

819
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,260
or the like.

820
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,130
And those are just the few
of the current ones now.

821
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:53,890
Any questions on any or all
of those past or future steps?

822
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:55,400
Anything at all?

823
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,143
No?

824
00:41:56,143 --> 00:41:58,180
All right.

825
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,500
OK, so we'll adjourn
in just a little bit

826
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,560
time for our tradition of
cake downstairs in the pub.

827
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,750
But we also have one other
tradition, especially now

828
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,135
that you have some 10 weeks
of experience behind you.

829
00:42:08,135 --> 00:42:10,010
For all intents and
purposes, you are all now

830
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:14,010
qualified as CS50 staff, because,
indeed, at the end of the day,

831
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:16,820
most of CS50 staff are recent
alumni of the course themselves,

832
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:20,300
sophomores, juniors, seniors, recent
graduates, students online who

833
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,960
have taken this class, maybe taken
another class in the spring or beyond,

834
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,430
and then joined us as staff.

835
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:28,670
So realize that even if you're
not feeling more comfortable yet,

836
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:31,400
or most comfortable, nor
are most of the staff,

837
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,507
and myself included, with
a lot of these things.

838
00:42:33,507 --> 00:42:36,590
And so long as you stay one step ahead
and you know the kinds of resources

839
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:40,100
to turn to, this is what it really
is about when learning in this world.

840
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,880
And in fact, a very common
mindset, I do know, in the class,

841
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,200
in the problem sets, in
the quiz, is wait a minute,

842
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,420
you didn't teach us this.

843
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:50,600
And that, odds are, was
quite true quite often.

844
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,620
And I don't just mean
to be rationalizing it.

845
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,270
That was very much by design.

846
00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:00,320
In the real world, that's exactly the
emotion you're hopefully going to feel,

847
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,300
or realistically going
to feel quite often.

848
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,940
And we truly do hope that
among the tools you've gotten,

849
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:08,570
training wheels and beyond, is to know
where to have the right instincts now

850
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:12,740
with how to bootstrap yourself, so to
speak, and solve problems, and learn

851
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,630
things on your own.

852
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:18,560
But we thought we would, in
conclusion put that to the test.

853
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,930
And I think for this, we need--

854
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,750
let's see, we have a bunch of chairs
up here, four student volunteers,

855
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,550
for about to be--

856
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:27,190
four about to be alumni volunteers.

857
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:29,960
OK, over here in the
front, yeah, come on down.

858
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,550
Over here, in the front, and three.

859
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:36,930
And let me try to see about
four, over here, come on down.

860
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:38,360
All right four, you have four?

861
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,680
Colton's going to join us.

862
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,940
Uh-oh, OK, we'll take five, that's
fine, but you gotta bring a chair.

863
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:46,730
We'll find a chair somewhere.

864
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:47,330
Come on down.

865
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:51,590
And now I need four staff
volunteers, if we could.

866
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:53,000
Who on the staff might--

867
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,430
Oh, yes, ma'am come on up.

868
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:57,050
Athena has volunteered.

869
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,340
Oh, Erin, would you like to--

870
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:58,940
oh, come up.

871
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,180
Yeah, who?

872
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,046
OK, yeah, come on up, Robert.

873
00:44:03,046 --> 00:44:04,670
OK, thank you so much for volunteering.

874
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:08,600
OK, so-- but the catch is, we
need the staff on their own team.

875
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,740
So let's put the students
here, because you need--

876
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,240
that's OK.

877
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,240
Could you guys go over here?

878
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:17,035
OK, all five of you-- we have
our student team over here.

879
00:44:17,035 --> 00:44:19,160
And we'll find you one more
chair in just a moment.

880
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,701
Staff, go ahead and take a seat here.

881
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:24,200
You each have a piece of
paper, a pen, and a microphone.

882
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,040
And why don't we go ahead,
as we get ready to go here--

883
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,687
do you want to each just say
hello and introduce yourself?

884
00:44:30,687 --> 00:44:31,186
ERIN: Hello.

885
00:44:31,186 --> 00:44:32,765
SPEAKER 1: Well, you can tell them.

886
00:44:32,765 --> 00:44:37,430
ERIN: Hello, I'm Erin, one
of the course preceptors.

887
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:39,560
ISAAC: I'm Isaac, I'm a TF.

888
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,075
ROBERT: I'm Robert, I'm a CA.

889
00:44:42,075 --> 00:44:45,950
ATHENA: And I'm Athena, I'm a TF.

890
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:50,240
ANDREA: Hi, I'm Andrea,
I'm an alumni, soon.

891
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,300
AVIVA: Hi, I'm Aviva, me too.

892
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,130
JONATHAN: I'm Jonathan.

893
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:56,610
APRIL: April.

894
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:57,595
ERIC: I'm Eric.

895
00:44:57,595 --> 00:44:59,949
COLTON: Hi, I Colton,
I'm a technologist.

896
00:44:59,949 --> 00:45:02,990
SPEAKER 1: All right, so what are we
all doing up here, you might wonder.

897
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:06,710
Well, we have this tradition
of using all of those questions

898
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:11,090
that you offered for the quiz, recall
in problem set seven, just a couple

899
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:13,010
of weeks ago, as refreshers.

900
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:15,770
Now mind you, there is quite
the difference between, I think,

901
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:19,370
a lot of the questions you offered
up at suggestions for quiz questions.

902
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:21,890
Many of them were like,
what is two in binary,

903
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:23,610
or maybe what is three in binary.

904
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:24,810
And so, that was great.

905
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:26,970
But we were looking for a
little harder questions.

906
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:28,178
And we get some of those too.

907
00:45:28,178 --> 00:45:30,350
And so Colton kindly went
through the thousands

908
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:33,230
of questions that were
submitted just a couple of weeks

909
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:37,370
ago, to pluck out some of the most
serious, some of the most playful ones.

910
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:40,730
And I have here them
clustered into categories,

911
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:44,720
because we have this tradition
of playing our own version, staff

912
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,720
versus students, of Jeopardy.

913
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,450
Now because you all wrote the
questions in the form of questions,

914
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:53,116
I'm going to read them in the
form of questions and not answers.

915
00:45:53,116 --> 00:45:56,840
So it's more of a quiz show, if
we could, staff versus students.

916
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,600
The first person to raise their
hand, we'll call on first.

917
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,250
We don't have buzzer technology here.

918
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:03,884
Colton will be our judge, if
you don't mind being the judge.

919
00:46:03,884 --> 00:46:06,050
And we'll do just a few
rounds of single and double,

920
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:09,270
and on Final Jeopardy, followed by cake.

921
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:11,420
So in a moment, we'll
show you the categories,

922
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,820
and begin asking the questions.

923
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:15,022
Do you have any questions of your own?

924
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,730
STUDENT: Are we
answering with questions?

925
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:18,510
SPEAKER 1: You will be
answering as an answer.

926
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:19,968
I'll ask the questions, you answer.

927
00:46:19,968 --> 00:46:23,000
So it's not really Jeopardy, but
it just kind of sounds better

928
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,020
if we call it Jeopardy.

929
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:30,670
OK, so-- and also, also, look at what
we made in HTML to facilitate this.

930
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:37,000
Let's zoom in.

931
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,910
Here we go, Enhance, whoo-hoo, look
at those HTML tables and links.

932
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:45,880
OK, so without further ado,
I think before today began,

933
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,170
we decided that the students
had won the coin toss.

934
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:50,170
Would you like to pick a
category, and then I'll

935
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:52,090
ask you a question in that category.

936
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:53,380
STUDENT: Scratch for 1,000.

937
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:57,194
SPEAKER 1: Scratch-- for $100?

938
00:46:57,194 --> 00:46:58,676
STUDENT: No, there's no $100.

939
00:46:58,676 --> 00:46:59,650
STUDENT: $1,000.

940
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,980
SPEAKER 1: Oh, I heard 1,000.

941
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,180
STUDENT: Yeah, 1,000.

942
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,880
SPEAKER 1: OK, so week--

943
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:11,920
week zero, week zero, the question
is what institution develop Scratch.

944
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,460
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

945
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,744
SPEAKER 1: Colton?

946
00:47:16,744 --> 00:47:19,540
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

947
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,730
SPEAKER 1: Whoever
raises their hand first.

948
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:22,690
COLTON: [INAUDIBLE]

949
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:25,300
SPEAKER 1: OK, OK, students.

950
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:25,930
STUDENT: MIT.

951
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:28,570
SPEAKER 1: MIT is the correct
answer for 1,000 points.

952
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:31,310
Very nicely done.

953
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,260
OK, if no one's going to clap--

954
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:34,410
[APPLAUSE]

955
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:35,450
SPEAKER 1: There we go.

956
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:37,150
No it's OK.

957
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:38,772
We have an HTML button for that too.

958
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:40,480
All right, so students,
you have control.

959
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,380
What would you like?

960
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:42,534
STUDENT: Scratch for 800.

961
00:47:42,534 --> 00:47:43,450
STUDENT: Yeah, I was--

962
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:44,310
SPEAKER 1: Scratch for what?

963
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:45,632
STUDENT: All the Scratch ones.

964
00:47:45,632 --> 00:47:46,090
STUDENT: Scratch for 800.

965
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:49,240
SPEAKER 1: Scratch for 800, working
our way through the Scratch questions.

966
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,240
OK, what color is the cat?

967
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:58,784
Students--

968
00:47:58,784 --> 00:47:59,760
STUDENT: Orange.

969

970
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,550
in P Set 7, and we got two answers--

971
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,590
yellow and orange.

972
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:10,230
Perhaps by a show of hands-- yellow--

973
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:13,880
orange.

974
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,380
OK, orange, students get the $800.

975
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,265
Very nicely done.

976
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,100
Students--

977
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,700
STUDENT: We should do something big.

978
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,450

I'm terrible with C.

979
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:28,210

980
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:28,940

STUDENT: Arrays for 1,000.

985
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:35,540
SPEAKER 1: Arrays for 1,000.

986
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:39,100
So this is from week two for 1,000.

987
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,955
This is going to be--

988
00:48:41,955 --> 00:48:43,580
what is the running time of merge sort?

989
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:53,920

992
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:02,597
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

993
00:49:02,597 --> 00:49:04,180

STAFF: 1,000.

998
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:14,278

999
00:49:14,278 --> 00:49:15,170
STAFF: Yeah.

1000
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:21,247
SPEAKER 1: OK, for 1,000, what
is the name of the tool you

1001
00:49:21,247 --> 00:49:22,580
can run to see if your program--

1002
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,410
staff?

1003
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:29,530
STAFF: Valgrind.

1004
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:34,350
SPEAKER 1: If your program has memory
leaks, Valgrind is correct, for 1,000.

1005
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:36,850
STAFF: [INAUDIBLE]

1006
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:37,756
STAFF: [INAUDIBLE]

1007
00:49:37,756 --> 00:49:38,630

1008
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:42,830
SPEAKER 1: Staff for 1,000,
what do you want next?

1009
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:45,070
STAFF: Week Star, what is that?

1010
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:48,070
SPEAKER 1: Oh, week star is the
wild card, so you can get any week.

1011
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,920
STAFF: Week Star for 1,000.

1012
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,820
SPEAKER 1: Week Star for 1,000.

1013
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:58,360
So I shall choose the category to be--

1014
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:04,680
what is rubber duck debugging?

1015
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:08,040
What is rubber duck debugging?

1016
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,260
Students?

1017
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:10,520
STUDENT: I'll answer it.

1018
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,280
It's when you read every
line of code to a rubber

1019
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,524
duck and to try and find a mistake.

1020
00:50:15,524 --> 00:50:16,940
SPEAKER 1: I think that's correct.

1021
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:18,410
Very well done for 1,000.

1022
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:21,259
[APPLAUSE]

1023
00:50:21,259 --> 00:50:24,300
All right, I think we have time for
one more question in single Jeopardy.

1024
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,840
Students you have control and the lead.

1025
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,010
STUDENT: Go for the lowest
possible [INAUDIBLE]..

1026
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:32,360
STUDENT: No, why don't we
try Week for 800, or C for--

1027
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,320
STUDENT: For like 200, because
then they can't catch up.

1028
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,050
STUDENT: So 200.

1029
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:39,906
STUDENT: Yeah.

1030
00:50:39,906 --> 00:50:41,750
SPEAKER 1: Students?

1031
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,000

1032
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,140
SPEAKER 1: For what?

1033
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:44,931

00:50:44,931 --> 00:50:47,320
SPEAKER 1: C for-- whoa, OK.

1035
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,890
C for 200 in week one.

1036
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:54,520
Week 1-- your question is going to be--

1037
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,930
is C the absolute worst?

1038
00:50:58,840 --> 00:50:59,770
Students, for 200?

1039
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:08,272
STUDENT: OK, I think it's not, because--

1040
00:51:08,272 --> 00:51:10,230
STUDENT: The person asking
that would say, yes,

1041
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:11,460
so we just have to match their answer.

1042
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,084
STUDENT: We have to match their answer?

1043
00:51:13,084 --> 00:51:15,180
SPEAKER 1: The correct
answers are right here.

1044
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:16,140
STUDENT: Yes.

1045
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,550
SPEAKER 1: No.

1046
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:19,950
This is what I'm told.

1047
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:21,090
STUDENT: Yes.

1048
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:23,399
SPEAKER 1: I hear two yeses and one no.

1049
00:51:23,399 --> 00:51:24,690
STUDENT: I stick by my opinion.

1050
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:26,224
STUDENT: Majority wins.

1051
00:51:26,224 --> 00:51:28,140
SPEAKER 1: The answer
is yes, it is the worst.

1052
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,230
STUDENT: Yes.

1053
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:31,290
SPEAKER 1: For 200.

1054
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:34,650
OK, so we're now moving
on to Double Jeopardy,

1055
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:37,500
where all the dollar values
are doubled and the categories

1056
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:41,370
have changed two later weeks,
still with one wild card.

1057
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:42,300
Students.

1058
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,530
STUDENT: Oh, god.

1059
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:46,140
SPEAKER 1: Python for 2,000.

1060
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,180
SPEAKER 1: For 2,000.

1061
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:49,232

00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:54,540
So that's week six.

1067
00:51:54,540 --> 00:52:01,740
Python for 2,000, and a question
that a classmate asked was,

1068
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:05,389
what is an animal that you don't want
to find under your pillow that shares

1069
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:06,930
its name with a programming language?

1070
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:11,820
Students.

1071
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:14,084
STUDENT: Python snake.

1072
00:52:14,084 --> 00:52:16,380
A python snake.

00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:20,670
SPEAKER 1: Python is
correct, yes, for $2,000.

1074

00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,797
Students, Python 6,000.

1076
00:52:27,797 --> 00:52:30,630

questions before we move on to final.

1080
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,670
SPEAKER 1: Web for 2,000,
that was week seven.

1081
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:43,210
And a question here
was, who is your friend?

1082
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:45,590
STUDENT: What?

1083
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:47,840
SPEAKER 1: Students for 2,000.

00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,670
Oh, did you see Erin first?

1085
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:51,230
Sorry, Colton's the judge.

1086
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:52,520
STAFF: Developer tools?

1087
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,040
SPEAKER 1: I'm sorry, that's incorrect.

1088
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,260

1090
00:52:58,757 --> 00:52:59,840

00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:03,850
Students, again?

1093
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:04,810
STUDENT: A rubber duck.

1094
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:06,393
SPEAKER 1: A rubber duck is incorrect.

1095
00:53:06,393 --> 00:53:07,400
STUDENT: Google.

1096
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,200
SPEAKER 1: Google, no.

1097
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,160
I think you're negative 8,000 now.

1098
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,890
But that's OK, we won't deduct.

1099
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,015
We won't deduct, it's fine.

1100
00:53:14,015 --> 00:53:15,681
I know that's not how Jeopardy's played.

1101
00:53:15,681 --> 00:53:16,320
OK.

1102
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,560
STAFF: W3 Schools?

1103
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,890
SPEAKER 1: W3 Schools, incorrect.

1104
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:21,275
Students-- What?

1105
00:53:21,275 --> 00:53:22,400

1106
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,671
SPEAKER 1: No, not him.

1107
00:53:23,671 --> 00:53:24,170
Yeah?

1108

STUDENT: Stack Exchange?

1109
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:25,610
SPEAKER 1: What?

1110
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:26,609
STUDENT: Stack Exchange?

1111
00:53:26,609 --> 00:53:29,720
SPEAKER 1: Not Stack Exchange.

1112
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,830
The answer is Bootstrap.

1113
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:34,910
OK, moving on.

1114
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:39,890
So time for two more
questions in Double Jeopardy.

1115
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:41,907
The students I think had control, right?

1116
00:53:41,907 --> 00:53:42,490
STUDENT: Yeah.

1117
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:43,900

1118
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,310

00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,650
Audience, what week shall we give them?

1125
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:56,080
One through seven, 0 through 7.

1126
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:59,080
Four, I heard.

1127
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,500
Week four.

1128
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:06,510
Week four-- what is the code for OK?

1129
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:07,770
Staff?

1130
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:09,642
STAFF: 200.

1131
00:54:09,642 --> 00:54:11,000
SPEAKER 1: 200 for 2,000.

1132
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,880
All right, so staff have control.

1133
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,168
We have time for one more question
before we move on to Final Jeopardy.

1134
00:54:17,168 --> 00:54:19,608
STAFF: [INAUDIBLE]

1135
00:54:19,608 --> 00:54:23,030
STAFF: No, we want to be able
to be in touch with it, right?

1136
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:24,650
Data structures, 1,200.

1137
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:27,650
SPEAKER 1: Data structures for 1,200.

1138
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:31,586
Data structures for 1,200.

1139
00:54:31,586 --> 00:54:32,960
And that was, what week was that?

1140
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,820
Four, that's week four.

1141
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:38,640
What do you call the
situation when a structure

1142
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,560
refers to itself in its definition?

1143
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,050
Students?

1144
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:44,990
STUDENT: Recursion.

1145
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:50,580
SPEAKER 1: Recursion is
correct for $1,200, very nice.

1146
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:55,980
OK, so we now go into our last question
of CS50 of staff versus students.

1147
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:58,890
Staff have 4,000, students have 6,200.

1148
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:02,702
You're about to be told the Final
Jeopardy category, at which point

1149
00:55:02,702 --> 00:55:05,910
each team needs to commit in writing,
on the sheet of paper in front of them,

1150
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:10,050
with the CS50 pen in front
of them, to a dollar amount,

1151
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:13,395
keeping in mind that you will
either gain or lose this amount.

1152
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:18,940
All right, go ahead
and choose your-- oh,

1153
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:27,380
here we go, the category for Final
Jeopardy is going to be Buggy.

1154
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:31,100
Buggy will be your category.

1155
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:31,995
Any dollar amount.

1156
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,520
Any dollar amount.

1157
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:48,320
OK, so, so, here we go.

1158
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:54,040
The question is, they've all
committed to a dollar amount.

1159
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:57,550
OK, I feel like you can
hedge your bets there.

1160
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:02,470
All right, so here we go, Final
Jeopardy, Buggy is the category.

1161
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:09,470
In which state, besides Massachusetts,
does Google sometimes think we reside?

1162
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:16,986
In which state, besides Massachusetts,
does Google sometimes think we reside?

1163
00:56:16,986 --> 00:56:49,440
[MUSIC PLAYING - "JEOPARDY THEME SONG"]

1164
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,170
All right.

1165
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:56,370
So, I think staff were not in
the lead, or not in the lead,

1166
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:58,150
so we start with you.

1167
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:01,900
Staff, first of all,
how much did you wager?

1168
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,250
OK, depending, I think,
on how the question went,

1169
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:09,380
they wagered either
$4,000 or $40, apparently.

1170
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:10,660
STAFF: [INAUDIBLE]

1171
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,630
SPEAKER 1: $40, will go with 4,000.

1172
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:15,030
And what was your answer?

1173
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:16,820
STAFF: We picked Kansas.

1174
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:18,240
SPEAKER 1: Kansas, interesting.

1175
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,825
Now, students, how much did you wager?

1176
00:57:20,825 --> 00:57:21,450
STUDENT: 2,000.

1177
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:23,070
SPEAKER 1: 2,000.

1178
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:25,000
and what was your answer?

1179
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,626
STUDENT: Also Kansas.

1180
00:57:26,626 --> 00:57:27,750
SPEAKER 1: And also Kansas.

1181
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:31,800
So 2,000 would bring you to 8,200.

1182
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,750
4,000 would bring you to 8,000.

1183
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:36,772
So if you're both right, students
you might have clinched it.

1184
00:57:36,772 --> 00:57:38,730
Does the audience remember
where Google thought

1185
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:41,310
we were a few weeks ago,
despite the fact that I

1186
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:46,700
misstated where Google thinks we were?

1187
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:51,430
Oklahoma was my incorrect
answer, it turns out.

1188
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:52,960
Wyoming, also incorrect.

1189
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,940
But we can do sort of
binary search in that area.

1190
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,775
Anyone at all?

1191
00:57:59,775 --> 00:58:00,650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1192
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:02,066
SPEAKER 1: It is, in fact, Kansas.

1193
00:58:02,066 --> 00:58:05,810
So congratulations to
the students' team.

1194
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:09,870
A round of applause, if we
could, for our students.

1195
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:11,579
Thank you so much for
joining us in CS50.

1196
00:58:11,579 --> 00:58:14,203
We are so proud of you all, cannot
wait to see you at the fair.

1197
00:58:14,203 --> 00:58:15,720
Cake is now served downstairs.

1198
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,790
And my thanks again to the staff.
