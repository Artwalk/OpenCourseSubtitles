layers and when people talk about deep
 

641
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:58,639
layers and when people talk about deep
neural networks it means there's a bunch

642
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:58,649
neural networks it means there's a bunch
 

643
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:01,309
neural networks it means there's a bunch
of those layers and then there's

00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:01,319
of those layers and then there's
 

645
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:02,780
of those layers and then there's
recurrent neural networks that are also

646

00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:49,760
you compute the measure of an error and
 

751
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,970
you compute the measure of an error and
you back propagate it to the network

752
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:52,980
you back propagate it to the network

so the input here is a cat and the

760
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:06,330
so the input here is a cat and the
 

761
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,519
so the input here is a cat and the

it's just guessing it doesn't know say I
don't know it's guessing cat well it

766
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:13,559
don't know it's guessing cat well it
 

767
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,639
don't know it's guessing cat well it
happens to be right so we have to this

768
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:16,649
happens to be right so we have to this
 

769
00:18:16,649 --> 00:18:19,220
happens to be right so we have to this
is the measure of error yes you got a

770
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:19,230
is the measure of error yes you got a
 

771
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,960
is the measure of error yes you got a
right and you have to back propagate

772
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:20,970
right and you have to back propagate
 

773
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,810
right and you have to back propagate
that error you have to reward the

774
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:23,820
that error you have to reward the
 

775
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,750
that error you have to reward the
network for doing a good job and all you

776
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:26,760
network for doing a good job and all you
 

777
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,610
network for doing a good job and all you
do what I mean by a reward there's

778
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:28,620
do what I mean by a reward there's
 

779
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,680
do what I mean by a reward there's
weights on each of those edges and so

780
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:30,690
weights on each of those edges and so
 

781
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,769
weights on each of those edges and so
the the node that individual neurons

782
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:33,779
the the node that individual neurons
 

783
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,930
the the node that individual neurons
that were responsible that back to that

784
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:35,940
that were responsible that back to that
 

785
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,000
that were responsible that back to that
cat neuron that cat neuron needs to be

786
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,010
cat neuron that cat neuron needs to be
 

787
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,940
cat neuron that cat neuron needs to be
rewarded for seeing the cat so you just

788
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:40,950
rewarded for seeing the cat so you just
 

789
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,710
rewarded for seeing the cat so you just
increase the weights on the neurons that

790
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:42,720
increase the weights on the neurons that
 

791
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,480
increase the weights on the neurons that
were associated with producing the

792
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:44,490
were associated with producing the
 

793
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,700
were associated with producing the
correct answer now you give it a picture

794
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:46,710
correct answer now you give it a picture
 

795
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,870
correct answer now you give it a picture
of a dog and the neural networks is cat

796
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:49,880
of a dog and the neural networks is cat
 

797
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,690
of a dog and the neural networks is cat
well that's an incorrect answer so no

798
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:53,700
well that's an incorrect answer so no
 

799
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,610

works and it works too it wins it's

1116
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:21,600
works and it works too it wins it's
 

1117
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,390
works and it works too it wins it's
amazing because that's exactly what we

1118
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:23,400
amazing because that's exactly what we
 

1119
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,980
amazing because that's exactly what we
do as human beings this is general

1120
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:24,990
do as human beings this is general
 

1121
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:28,190
do as human beings this is general
intelligence so I need you to pause and

1122
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:28,200
intelligence so I need you to pause and
 

1123
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,740
intelligence so I need you to pause and
think about this well we'll talk about

1124
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:30,750
think about this well we'll talk about
 

1125
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,450
think about this well we'll talk about
special intelligence - the usefulness

1126
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:32,460
special intelligence - the usefulness
 

1127
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,250
special intelligence - the usefulness
and it ok there's cool tricks here and

1128
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:34,260
and it ok there's cool tricks here and
 

1129
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,700
and it ok there's cool tricks here and
there that we can do to get you an edge

1130
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:37,710
there that we can do to get you an edge
 

1131
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,860
there that we can do to get you an edge

but this is general intelligence general
 

1135
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,549
but this is general intelligence general
intelligence is the same intelligence we

we know nothing and with that input we
 

1149
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:06,820

1213
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,919
hasn't seen the best let me pause a
second and maybe if you have any

00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:48,929
second and maybe if you have any
 

1215
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:50,779
second and maybe if you have any
questions does anyone have any questions

1216
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:50,789
questions does anyone have any questions
 

1217
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:51,660
questions does anyone have any questions
about

1218
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:51,670
about
 

1219
00:28:51,670 --> 00:29:14,740
about
the techniques of neural networks yes

1220
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:14,750

 

1221
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,310

so that's a great question and in a

1222
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:18,320
so that's a great question and in a
 

1223
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,900
so that's a great question and in a
couple of slides I'll get to it exactly

1224
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:19,910
couple of slides I'll get to it exactly
 

1225
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:25,420
couple of slides I'll get to it exactly
so the the the data representation I'll

1226
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:25,430
so the the the data representation I'll
 

1227
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,820
so the the the data representation I'll
elaborate in a little bit but loosely

1228
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:27,830
elaborate in a little bit but loosely
 

1229
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,280
elaborate in a little bit but loosely
the data representation is for a neural

1230
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:30,290
the data representation is for a neural
 

1231
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:35,620
the data representation is for a neural
network is in the weights of each of

1232
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:35,630
network is in the weights of each of
 

1233
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,900
network is in the weights of each of
those arrows that connecting your ons

1234
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:37,910
those arrows that connecting your ons
 

1235
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,870
those arrows that connecting your ons
that's where the representation is so

1236
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:40,880
that's where the representation is so
 

1237
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,110
that's where the representation is so
I'll show to really clarify that example

1238
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:44,120
I'll show to really clarify that example
 

1239
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:50,500
I'll show to really clarify that example
of what that means the Cartesian versus

1240
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:50,510
of what that means the Cartesian versus
 

1241
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,330
of what that means the Cartesian versus
polar coordinates is just the visual

1242
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:52,340
polar coordinates is just the visual
 

1243
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:56,760
polar coordinates is just the visual
very simple visualization of the concept

1244
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:56,770
very simple visualization of the concept
 

1245
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:00,250
very simple visualization of the concept
but you want to be able to represent the

1246
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:00,260
but you want to be able to represent the
 

1247
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,070
but you want to be able to represent the
data in an arbitrary way where there's

1248
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:03,080
data in an arbitrary way where there's
 

1249
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,930
data in an arbitrary way where there's
no limits to the representation it could

1250
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:04,940
no limits to the representation it could
 

1251
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,130
no limits to the representation it could
be highly nonlinear highly complex any

1252
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:09,140
be highly nonlinear highly complex any
 

1253
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:44,690
be highly nonlinear highly complex any
other questions

1254
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:44,700

 

1255
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,299

so I have a couple of slides almost

1256
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:47,309
so I have a couple of slides almost
 

1257
00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:49,610
so I have a couple of slides almost
asking this questions because there's no

1258
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:49,620
asking this questions because there's no
 

1259
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,340
asking this questions because there's no
good answers but one could argue and I

1260
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:52,350
good answers but one could argue and I
 

1261
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,200
good answers but one could argue and I
think somebody in last class brought up

1262
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:54,210
think somebody in last class brought up
 

1263
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:56,029
think somebody in last class brought up
that you know is machine learning just

1264
00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:56,039
that you know is machine learning just
 

1265
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:01,940
that you know is machine learning just
pattern recognition it's possible that

1266
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:01,950
pattern recognition it's possible that
 

1267
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:08,600
pattern recognition it's possible that
reasoning thinking is just pattern

1268
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:08,610
reasoning thinking is just pattern
 

1269
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:13,580
reasoning thinking is just pattern
recognition and I'll describe sort of an

1270
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:13,590
recognition and I'll describe sort of an
 

1271
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:20,049
recognition and I'll describe sort of an
intuition behind that so we tend to

00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:29,429
it in our evolutionary time we think
 

1279
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,249
it in our evolutionary time we think
that it's somehow special from for

started to learn to reason I think about

1290
00:31:43,879 --> 00:31:43,889
started to learn to reason I think about
 

1291
00:31:43,889 --> 00:31:46,999
started to learn to reason I think about
a hundred thousand years ago so we think

1292
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:47,009
a hundred thousand years ago so we think
 

1293
00:31:47,009 --> 00:31:50,210
a hundred thousand years ago so we think
it's somehow special from the same kind

1294
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:50,220
it's somehow special from the same kind

it's somehow special from the same kind
of mechanism we use for seeing things

00:31:52,149 --> 00:31:52,159
of mechanism we use for seeing things
 

1297
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,190
of mechanism we use for seeing things
perhaps it's exactly the same thing it's

1298
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:55,200
perhaps it's exactly the same thing it's
 

1299
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,220
perhaps it's exactly the same thing it's
so perception is pattern recognition

1300
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:57,230
so perception is pattern recognition
 

1301
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:00,409
so perception is pattern recognition
perhaps reasoning is just a few more

00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,740
very small piece of information that we
just we know are important like there is

00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:15,170
to slow down so hard questions so the
 

1405
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:17,320
to slow down so hard questions so the
question was how do you detect the

1406
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:17,330
question was how do you detect the
 

1407
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:23,890
question was how do you detect the
traffic light and lights so how do we do

1408
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:23,900
traffic light and lights so how do we do
 

1409
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,110
traffic light and lights so how do we do
it as human beings first of all let's

1410
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:26,120
it as human beings first of all let's
 

1411
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:30,880
it as human beings first of all let's
start there the way we do it is by the

1412
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:30,890
start there the way we do it is by the
 

1413
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:33,820
start there the way we do it is by the
knowledge we'll bring to the table so we

1414
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:33,830
knowledge we'll bring to the table so we
 

1415
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,680
knowledge we'll bring to the table so we
we know what it means to be on the road

1416
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:35,690
we know what it means to be on the road
 

1417
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,050
we know what it means to be on the road
there's a lot of the huge network of

1418
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:38,060
there's a lot of the huge network of
 

1419
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,090
there's a lot of the huge network of
knowledge that you come with and so that

1420
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:40,100
knowledge that you come with and so that
 

1421
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,770
knowledge that you come with and so that
makes the perception problem much easier

1422
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:41,780
makes the perception problem much easier
 

1423
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:44,260
makes the perception problem much easier
this is pure perception you take an

1424
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:44,270
this is pure perception you take an
 

1425
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:45,910
this is pure perception you take an
image and you separate different parts

1426
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:45,920
image and you separate different parts
 

1427
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,280
image and you separate different parts
based purely on tiny patterns of pixels

1428
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:50,290
based purely on tiny patterns of pixels
 

1429
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:53,980
based purely on tiny patterns of pixels

end-to-end in any application what that
 

1645
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:29,690
end-to-end in any application what that
means is you start from the very raw

00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:29,700
means is you start from the very raw
 

1647
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,180
means is you start from the very raw

just taking the external scene as input

1666
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:55,770
just taking the external scene as input
 

1667
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:58,310
just taking the external scene as input
and as output produced steering and

1668
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:58,320
and as output produced steering and
 

1669
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,410
and as output produced steering and
acceleration of braking commands

1670

00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:03,000
and so in this way taking this input is
 

1673
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,900
and so in this way taking this input is

put a single number that gives you the
 

1683
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:24,410
put a single number that gives you the
steering of the of the car okay

00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,970
artificial intelligence especially
machine learning as it realizes itself

2214
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:22,980
machine learning as it realizes itself
 

2215
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:24,740
machine learning as it realizes itself
through robotics gets to impact the

2216
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:24,750
through robotics gets to impact the
 

2217
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,210
through robotics gets to impact the
world we start thinking about what are

2218
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:26,220
world we start thinking about what are
 

2219
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:27,680
world we start thinking about what are
the easy problems what are the hard

2220
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:27,690
the easy problems what are the hard
 

2221
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:33,290
the easy problems what are the hard
problems and it seems to us that vision

2222
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:33,300
problems and it seems to us that vision
 

2223
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:36,350
problems and it seems to us that vision
and movement walking is easy because

2224
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:36,360
and movement walking is easy because
 

2225
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,000
and movement walking is easy because
we've been doing it for millions of

2226
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,010
we've been doing it for millions of
 

2227
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:39,860
we've been doing it for millions of
years hundreds of millions of years and

2228
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:39,870
years hundreds of millions of years and
 

2229
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:42,860
years hundreds of millions of years and
thinking it's hard reasoning is hard I

2230
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:42,870
thinking it's hard reasoning is hard I
 

2231
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:45,260
thinking it's hard reasoning is hard I
propose to you that it's perhaps because

2232
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:45,270
propose to you that it's perhaps because
 

2233
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:46,850
propose to you that it's perhaps because
we've only been doing it for a short

2234
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:46,860
we've only been doing it for a short
 

2235
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:49,550
we've only been doing it for a short
time and so so think we're quite special

2236
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:49,560
time and so so think we're quite special
 

2237
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,620
time and so so think we're quite special
because we're able to think so we have

2238
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:51,630
because we're able to think so we have
 

2239
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:53,750
because we're able to think so we have
to kind of question of what it's easy

2240
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:53,760
to kind of question of what it's easy
 

2241
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,360
to kind of question of what it's easy
and what is hard because when we start

2242
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:56,370
and what is hard because when we start
 

2243
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:59,240
and what is hard because when we start
to develop some of these systems and

2244
00:54:59,240 --> 00:54:59,250
to develop some of these systems and
 

2245
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:01,820
to develop some of these systems and
what you start to realize that all these

2246
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:01,830
what you start to realize that all these
 

2247
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:04,160
what you start to realize that all these
problems are equally hard so the problem

2248
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:04,170
problems are equally hard so the problem
 

2249
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:05,900
problems are equally hard so the problem
of walking that we take for granted the

2250
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:05,910
of walking that we take for granted the
 

2251
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:09,260
of walking that we take for granted the
actuation and the physical the ability

2252
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:09,270
actuation and the physical the ability
 

2253
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:11,930
actuation and the physical the ability
to recognize where you are in the

2254
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:11,940
to recognize where you are in the
 

2255
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,910
to recognize where you are in the
physical space the sense the world

2256
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:13,920
physical space the sense the world
 

2257
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,720
physical space the sense the world
around you to deal deal with the

2258
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:17,730
around you to deal deal with the
 

2259
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:20,300
around you to deal deal with the
uncertainty of the perception problem

2260
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:20,310
uncertainty of the perception problem
 

2261
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:23,240
uncertainty of the perception problem
and then so all of these robots by the

2262
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:23,250
and then so all of these robots by the
 

2263
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:25,220
and then so all of these robots by the
way this is for the most recent DARPA

2264
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:25,230
way this is for the most recent DARPA
 

2265
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:29,240
way this is for the most recent DARPA
challenge which MIT was also part of and

2266
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:29,250
challenge which MIT was also part of and
 

2267
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:32,710
challenge which MIT was also part of and
so what what are these robots doing they

2268
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:32,720
so what what are these robots doing they
 

2269
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,540
so what what are these robots doing they
they don't have any they only have

2270
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:35,550
they don't have any they only have
 

2271
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:37,730
they don't have any they only have
sparse communication with human beings

2272
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:37,740
sparse communication with human beings
 

2273
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,880
sparse communication with human beings
on the periphery so most of the stuff

2274
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:40,890
on the periphery so most of the stuff
 

2275
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:42,560
on the periphery so most of the stuff
they have to do autonomously like get

2276
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:42,570
they have to do autonomously like get
 

2277
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:44,360
they have to do autonomously like get
inside a car this is an MIT robot

2278
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:44,370
inside a car this is an MIT robot
 

2279
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:47,450
inside a car this is an MIT robot
unfortunately that they have to get in

2280
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:47,460
unfortunately that they have to get in
 

2281
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,040
unfortunately that they have to get in
the car and the hardest tasks they have

2282
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:49,050
the car and the hardest tasks they have
 

2283
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:53,330
the car and the hardest tasks they have
to get out of the car that's walking so

2284
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:53,340
to get out of the car that's walking so
 

2285
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:56,800
to get out of the car that's walking so
this kind of raises to you the very real

2286
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:56,810
this kind of raises to you the very real
 

2287
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:59,000
this kind of raises to you the very real

00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:02,430
real world and that's the first
 

2293
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:04,710
real world and that's the first
challenge an opportunity here

2294
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:04,720
challenge an opportunity here
 

2295
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,059
challenge an opportunity here
than many of the technologies we talked

them from a small data set in the lab to
 

2303
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:21,700
them from a small data set in the lab to

2304
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:21,710
the real world for the computer vision
 

2305
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:23,289
the real world for the computer vision
is perhaps one of the best illustrations

2306
00:56:23,289 --> 00:56:23,299
is perhaps one of the best illustrations
 

2307
00:56:23,299 --> 00:56:26,019
is perhaps one of the best illustrations
of this computer vision is the task as

00:56:26,019 --> 00:56:26,029
of this computer vision is the task as
 

2309
00:56:26,029 --> 00:56:28,319
of this computer vision is the task as
we talked about of interpreting images

2310
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:28,329
we talked about of interpreting images
 

2311
00:56:28,329 --> 00:56:31,299
we talked about of interpreting images
and so when you there's been a lot of

2312
00:56:31,299 --> 00:56:31,309
and so when you there's been a lot of
 

2313
00:56:31,309 --> 00:56:32,769
and so when you there's been a lot of
great accomplishments on interpreting

2314
00:56:32,769 --> 00:56:32,779
great accomplishments on interpreting
 

2315
00:56:32,779 --> 00:56:36,609
great accomplishments on interpreting
images cats versus dogs now when you try

2316
00:56:36,609 --> 00:56:36,619
images cats versus dogs now when you try
 

2317
00:56:36,619 --> 00:56:41,009
images cats versus dogs now when you try
to create a system like the Tesla

2318
00:56:41,009 --> 00:56:41,019
to create a system like the Tesla
 

2319
00:56:41,019 --> 00:56:44,289
to create a system like the Tesla
vehicle that I've often that we work

2320
00:56:44,289 --> 00:56:44,299
vehicle that I've often that we work
 

2321
00:56:44,299 --> 00:56:49,480
vehicle that I've often that we work
with and I always talk about is it's a

2322
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:49,490
with and I always talk about is it's a
 

2323
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:52,569
with and I always talk about is it's a
vision based robot right as radar for

2324
00:56:52,569 --> 00:56:52,579
vision based robot right as radar for
 

2325
00:56:52,579 --> 00:56:54,700
vision based robot right as radar for
basic obstacle avoidance but most of the

2326
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:54,710
basic obstacle avoidance but most of the
 

2327
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:56,019
basic obstacle avoidance but most of the
understanding of the world comes from a

2328
00:56:56,019 --> 00:56:56,029
understanding of the world comes from a
 

2329
00:56:56,029 --> 00:56:58,150
understanding of the world comes from a
single monocular camera now they've

2330
00:56:58,150 --> 00:56:58,160
single monocular camera now they've
 

2331
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,740
single monocular camera now they've
expanded the number of cameras but for

2332
00:56:59,740 --> 00:56:59,750
expanded the number of cameras but for
 

2333
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,569
expanded the number of cameras but for
the most time there's been a hundred

2334
00:57:01,569 --> 00:57:01,579
the most time there's been a hundred
 

2335
00:57:01,579 --> 00:57:03,069
the most time there's been a hundred
thousand vehicles driving on the roads

2336
00:57:03,069 --> 00:57:03,079
thousand vehicles driving on the roads
 

2337
00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:06,220
thousand vehicles driving on the roads
today with a single essentially a single

2338
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:06,230
today with a single essentially a single
 

2339
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:10,299
today with a single essentially a single
webcam so when you start to do that you

2340
00:57:10,299 --> 00:57:10,309
webcam so when you start to do that you
 

2341
00:57:10,309 --> 00:57:12,700
webcam so when you start to do that you
have to perform all of these extraction

2342
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:12,710
have to perform all of these extraction
 

2343
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:15,460
have to perform all of these extraction
of texture color optical flow so the the

2344
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:15,470
of texture color optical flow so the the
 

2345
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:16,839
of texture color optical flow so the the
movement through time temporal dynamics

2346
00:57:16,839 --> 00:57:16,849
movement through time temporal dynamics
 

2347
00:57:16,849 --> 00:57:19,539
movement through time temporal dynamics
of the images you have to construct

2348
00:57:19,539 --> 00:57:19,549
of the images you have to construct
 

2349
00:57:19,549 --> 00:57:20,920
of the images you have to construct
these patterns construct the

2350
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:20,930
these patterns construct the
 

2351
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:22,390
these patterns construct the
understanding of objects and entities

2352
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:22,400
understanding of objects and entities
 

2353
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,120
understanding of objects and entities
and how they interact and from that you

2354
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:25,130
and how they interact and from that you
 

2355
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:27,160
and how they interact and from that you
have to act in this world and that's all

2356
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:27,170
have to act in this world and that's all
 

2357
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:29,259
have to act in this world and that's all
based on this computer vision system so

2358
00:57:29,259 --> 00:57:29,269
based on this computer vision system so
 

2359
00:57:29,269 --> 00:57:32,789
based on this computer vision system so
it's no longer cats versus dogs it's

2360
00:57:32,789 --> 00:57:32,799
it's no longer cats versus dogs it's
 

2361
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:36,759
it's no longer cats versus dogs it's
it's a huge detection of pedestrians or

2362
00:57:36,759 --> 00:57:36,769
it's a huge detection of pedestrians or
 

2363
00:57:36,769 --> 00:57:40,710
it's a huge detection of pedestrians or
the wrong classification the wrong

2364
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:40,720
the wrong classification the wrong
 

2365
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,480
the wrong classification the wrong
detection is the difference between life

2366
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:43,490
detection is the difference between life
 

2367
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:46,509
detection is the difference between life
and death so let's look at cats those

2368
00:57:46,509 --> 00:57:46,519

00:57:49,089 --> 00:57:49,099
were things a little more comfortable so

computer vision and I would like to

2372
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:50,750
computer vision and I would like to
 

2373
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:53,200
computer vision and I would like to
illustrate to you why this is such a

2374
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:53,210
illustrate to you why this is such a
 

2375
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:56,079
illustrate to you why this is such a
hard task which we've talked about we've

2376
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:56,089
hard task which we've talked about we've
 

2377
00:57:56,089 --> 00:57:58,059
hard task which we've talked about we've
been doing it for 500 million years so

2378
00:57:58,059 --> 00:57:58,069
been doing it for 500 million years so
 

2379
00:57:58,069 --> 00:58:00,789
been doing it for 500 million years so
we think it's easy computer vision is

2380
00:58:00,789 --> 00:58:00,799
we think it's easy computer vision is
 

2381
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:02,559
we think it's easy computer vision is
actually incredible so all you're

2382
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:02,569
actually incredible so all you're
 

2383
00:58:02,569 --> 00:58:04,660
actually incredible so all you're
getting with your human eyes is you're

2384
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:04,670
getting with your human eyes is you're
 

2385
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:06,190
getting with your human eyes is you're
getting essentially pixels in there's

2386
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:06,200
getting essentially pixels in there's
 

2387
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,200
getting essentially pixels in there's
light coming into your eyes and all

2388
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:08,210
light coming into your eyes and all
 

2389
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:10,240
light coming into your eyes and all
you're getting is the reflection from

2390
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:10,250
you're getting is the reflection from
 

2391
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:13,059
you're getting is the reflection from
the different surfaces in here of light

2392
00:58:13,059 --> 00:58:13,069
the different surfaces in here of light
 

2393
00:58:13,069 --> 00:58:16,299
the different surfaces in here of light
and there's perception they're sensors

2394
00:58:16,299 --> 00:58:16,309
and there's perception they're sensors
 

2395
00:58:16,309 --> 00:58:17,830
and there's perception they're sensors
inside your eyes can

2396
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:17,840
inside your eyes can

00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:19,610
burning that into numbers it's really
 

2399
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:23,350
burning that into numbers it's really
very similar to this numbers in this in

00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:23,360
very similar to this numbers in this in
 

2401
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,880
very similar to this numbers in this in
the case of what we use with computers

RGB images or the individual pixels that
 

2405
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:32,020
RGB images or the individual pixels that
are numbers from 0 to 255 so 256

2406
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:32,030
are numbers from 0 to 255 so 256
 

2407
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:33,280
are numbers from 0 to 255 so 256
possible numbers and there's just a

00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:33,290
possible numbers and there's just a
 

2409
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:35,200
possible numbers and there's just a
bunch of them and that's all we get we

2410
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:35,210
bunch of them and that's all we get we
 

2411
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:37,120
bunch of them and that's all we get we
get a collection of numbers where

2412
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:37,130
get a collection of numbers where
 

2413
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:39,070
get a collection of numbers where
they're spatially connected ones that

we have to help us but the rest of it is
 

2423
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:48,820
we have to help us but the rest of it is
just numbers intensity in hours and we

00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:48,830
just numbers intensity in hours and we
 

2425
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:50,410
just numbers intensity in hours and we
have to use those numbers to classify

have to use those numbers to classify
 

2427
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:54,910
have to use those numbers to classify
what's in the image and if you really

be able to reason about this image with
 

2609
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:46,410
be able to reason about this image with

2611
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:48,269
object in the scene most of us are able
to very easily detect if there's a cat

2612
01:02:48,269 --> 01:02:48,279
to very easily detect if there's a cat
 

2613
01:02:48,279 --> 01:02:51,120
to very easily detect if there's a cat
in this image we're able to detect that

in this image we're able to detect that
there is a cat in this image now think

2616
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:53,200
there is a cat in this image now think
 

2617
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,870
there is a cat in this image now think
about this there's a single eye and

2618
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:54,880
about this there's a single eye and
 

2619
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,380
about this there's a single eye and
there's an ear so you have to think

2620
01:02:58,380 --> 01:02:58,390
there's an ear so you have to think
 

2621
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:01,529
there's an ear so you have to think
about what is it part of our brain that

2622
01:03:01,529 --> 01:03:01,539
about what is it part of our brain that
 

2623
01:03:01,539 --> 01:03:04,769
about what is it part of our brain that
allows us to understand to suppose that

2624
01:03:04,769 --> 01:03:04,779
allows us to understand to suppose that
 

2625
01:03:04,779 --> 01:03:07,349
allows us to understand to suppose that
with some high degree of accuracy that

2626
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:07,359
with some high degree of accuracy that
 

2627
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:09,059
with some high degree of accuracy that
there's a cat here in this picture I

2628
01:03:09,059 --> 01:03:09,069
there's a cat here in this picture I
 

2629
01:03:09,069 --> 01:03:11,339
there's a cat here in this picture I
mean the degree of occlusion here is

2630
01:03:11,339 --> 01:03:11,349
mean the degree of occlusion here is
 

2631
01:03:11,349 --> 01:03:11,910
mean the degree of occlusion here is
immense

2632
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:11,920
immense
 

2633
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:16,440
immense
and so I promise so this is for most of

2634
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:16,450
and so I promise so this is for most of
 

2635
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:21,029
and so I promise so this is for most of
you some of you will think this is in

you some of you will think this is in
 

2637
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:23,339
you some of you will think this is in
fact a monkey eating a banana but I

2638
01:03:23,339 --> 01:03:23,349
fact a monkey eating a banana but I
 

2639
01:03:23,349 --> 01:03:25,680
fact a monkey eating a banana but I
would venture to say that most of us are

01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:25,690
would venture to say that most of us are

you're seeing an ostrich when there is
 

2837
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,270
you're seeing an ostrich when there is
in fact no ostrich you can do the same

01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:51,280
in fact no ostrich you can do the same
 

2839
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:55,950
in fact no ostrich you can do the same
thing in a in an attacking way so you

01:07:55,950 --> 01:07:55,960
thing in a in an attacking way so you
 

2841
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,630
thing in a in an attacking way so you
can attack the sensors of a car and make

01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:09,400
the opposite to hide pedestrians make
 

2853
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,190
the opposite to hide pedestrians make

they're in fact there so whenever you
 

2857
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:16,710

2869
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:32,460
there's a failure you have to be able to
detect that failure and right now we

2870
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:32,470
detect that failure and right now we
 

2871
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:33,930
detect that failure and right now we
have no mechanisms for automatically

have no mechanisms for automatically
 

2873
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:37,320
have no mechanisms for automatically
detecting that failure so on the data

human computation is using something
 

2991
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:24,450
human computation is using something
about our behavior something about what

2992

about our behavior something about what
 

2993
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:26,100
about our behavior something about what
we do in this world online or in the

2994
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:26,110
we do in this world online or in the
 

2995
01:11:26,110 --> 01:11:28,800
we do in this world online or in the
real world to annotate data

2996
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:28,810
real world to annotate data
 

2997
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:34,080
real world to annotate data
automatically so for example as you

2998
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:34,090
automatically so for example as you
 

2999
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:37,290
automatically so for example as you
drive which is what we do everybody has

3000
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:37,300
drive which is what we do everybody has
 

3001

3055
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,520
supervised learning at the very top is
what we have all of our successes and

everything else is where the promise
 

3059
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:52,810
everything else is where the promise
lies the semi-supervised the

lies the semi-supervised the
 

3061
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:55,030
lies the semi-supervised the

learning where the input from the human
 

3065
01:12:57,170 --> 01:12:59,530
learning where the input from the human
is very minimal and another way to think

3066
01:12:59,530 --> 01:12:59,540
is very minimal and another way to think
 

3067
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:02,500
is very minimal and another way to think
about this so every whenever you think

3068
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:02,510
about this so every whenever you think
 

3069
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:04,090
about this so every whenever you think
about machine learning today

3070
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:04,100
about machine learning today
 

3071
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:05,620
about machine learning today
whenever somebody talks about machine

3072
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:05,630
whenever somebody talks about machine
 

3073
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:07,450
whenever somebody talks about machine
learning what they're talking about is

3074
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:07,460
learning what they're talking about is
 

3075
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:10,000
learning what they're talking about is
systems that memorize that memorize

systems that memorize that memorize
 

3077
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:13,570
systems that memorize that memorize
patterns and so this is one of the big

3078
01:13:13,570 --> 01:13:13,580
patterns and so this is one of the big
 

3079
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:15,760

01:19:32,410 --> 01:19:34,380
that's our pitch for this competition so
deep neural networks can help and so you

3368
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:34,390
deep neural networks can help and so you
 

3369
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:36,330
deep neural networks can help and so you
have a neural network that drives that

3378
01:19:45,930 --> 01:19:45,940
and trying to achieve a speed of 80
 

3379
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:47,760
and trying to achieve a speed of 80
miles an hour which is the speed limit

3380
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:47,770
miles an hour which is the speed limit
 

3381
01:19:47,770 --> 01:19:50,220
miles an hour which is the speed limit
which is a physical speed limit of the

which is a physical speed limit of the
 

3383
01:19:50,230 --> 01:19:52,230
which is a physical speed limit of the
car of course the actual speed limit of

01:19:52,230 --> 01:19:52,240
car of course the actual speed limit of
 

3385
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:54,390
car of course the actual speed limit of
the road is 65 miles an hour but we

3386
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:54,400
the road is 65 miles an hour but we
 

3387
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,500
the road is 65 miles an hour but we
don't care about that we just want to

01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:55,510
don't care about that we just want to
 

3389
01:19:55,510 --> 01:19:56,970
don't care about that we just want to
get to work as quickly as possible at

01:19:56,970 --> 01:19:56,980
get to work as quickly as possible at
 

3391
01:19:56,980 --> 01:20:02,400
get to work as quickly as possible at
home so what the basic structure of this

3392
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:02,410
home so what the basic structure of this
 

3393
01:20:02,410 --> 01:20:04,230
home so what the basic structure of this
game is and I want to explain this game

3394
01:20:04,230 --> 01:20:04,240
game is and I want to explain this game
 

3395
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,390
game is and I want to explain this game
a little bit and then tell you how

3396
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:06,400
a little bit and then tell you how
 

3397
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,150
a little bit and then tell you how
incredibly popular it's gotten and how

3398
01:20:09,150 --> 01:20:09,160
incredibly popular it's gotten and how
 

3399
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:14,520
incredibly popular it's gotten and how
incredibly powerful the networks that

3400
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:14,530
incredibly powerful the networks that
 

3401
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:16,680
incredibly powerful the networks that
people built from all over the world the

3402
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:16,690
people built from all over the world the
 

3403
01:20:16,690 --> 01:20:18,480
people built from all over the world the
community has built of this over a

single month is incredible and this

3406
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:20,470
single month is incredible and this
 

3407
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:22,770
single month is incredible and this
happens for thousands of projects out

3408

01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:28,690
opportunity ok so you may have seen this
 

3413
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:30,640
opportunity ok so you may have seen this
this is kind of ethics

3414
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:30,650
this is kind of ethics
 

3415
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:34,000
this is kind of ethics
most engineers most I don't like I love

3416
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:34,010
most engineers most I don't like I love
 

3417
01:20:34,010 --> 01:20:37,180
most engineers most I don't like I love
the love philosophy but this kind of

3418
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:37,190
the love philosophy but this kind of
 

3419
01:20:37,190 --> 01:20:38,590
the love philosophy but this kind of
construction of ethics that's often

3420
01:20:38,590 --> 01:20:38,600
construction of ethics that's often
 

3421
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,410
construction of ethics that's often
presented here is one that is not

3422
01:20:41,410 --> 01:20:41,420
presented here is one that is not
 

3423
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:43,690
presented here is one that is not
usually concerned to engineering so what

3424
01:20:43,690 --> 01:20:43,700
usually concerned to engineering so what
 

3425
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:45,430
usually concerned to engineering so what
is this question you know when you have

3426
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:45,440
is this question you know when you have
 

3427
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,890
is this question you know when you have
a car you have a bunch of pedestrians do

3428
01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:47,900
a car you have a bunch of pedestrians do
 

3429
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:49,930
a car you have a bunch of pedestrians do
you hit the larger group of pedestrians

3430
01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:49,940
you hit the larger group of pedestrians
 

3431
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:51,760
you hit the larger group of pedestrians
or the smaller group of pedestrians do

3432
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:51,770
or the smaller group of pedestrians do
 

3433
01:20:51,770 --> 01:20:54,700
or the smaller group of pedestrians do
you avoid the group of pedestrians but

3434
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:54,710
you avoid the group of pedestrians but
 

3435
01:20:54,710 --> 01:20:56,980
you avoid the group of pedestrians but
put yourself into danger these kinds of

3436
01:20:56,980 --> 01:20:56,990
put yourself into danger these kinds of
 

3437
01:20:56,990 --> 01:20:59,110
put yourself into danger these kinds of
ethical questions of an intelligent

3438
01:20:59,110 --> 01:20:59,120
ethical questions of an intelligent
 

3439
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,140
ethical questions of an intelligent
system it's a very interesting question

3440
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:01,150
system it's a very interesting question
 

3441
01:21:01,150 --> 01:21:03,790
system it's a very interesting question
it's it's one that we can debate and

3442
01:21:03,790 --> 01:21:03,800
it's it's one that we can debate and
 

3443
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:05,440
it's it's one that we can debate and
there's really no good answer quite

3444
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:05,450
there's really no good answer quite
 

3445
01:21:05,450 --> 01:21:07,480
there's really no good answer quite
honestly but it's a problem that both

3446
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:07,490
honestly but it's a problem that both
 

3447
01:21:07,490 --> 01:21:09,580
honestly but it's a problem that both
humans and machines struggle with and so

3448
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:09,590
humans and machines struggle with and so
 

3449
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:11,080
humans and machines struggle with and so
it's not interesting on the engineering

3450
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:11,090
it's not interesting on the engineering
 

3451
01:21:11,090 --> 01:21:13,270
it's not interesting on the engineering
side we're interested with problems that

3452
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:13,280
side we're interested with problems that
 

3453
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,310
side we're interested with problems that
we can solve on the engineering side so

3454
01:21:15,310 --> 01:21:15,320
we can solve on the engineering side so
 

3455
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:17,350
we can solve on the engineering side so
the kind of problem that I am obsessed

3456
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:17,360
the kind of problem that I am obsessed
 

3457
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,180
the kind of problem that I am obsessed
with and very interested in is the

3458
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:19,190
with and very interested in is the
 

3459
01:21:19,190 --> 01:21:20,800
with and very interested in is the
real-world problem of controlling a

3460
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:20,810
real-world problem of controlling a
 

3461
01:21:20,810 --> 01:21:23,620
real-world problem of controlling a
vehicle through this space so there's it

3462
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:23,630
vehicle through this space so there's it
 

3463
01:21:23,630 --> 01:21:26,710
vehicle through this space so there's it
happens in in a few seconds here so this

3464
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:26,720
happens in in a few seconds here so this
 

3465
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,750
happens in in a few seconds here so this
is a Manhattan New York intersection

3466
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:28,760
is a Manhattan New York intersection
 

3467
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,970
is a Manhattan New York intersection
right

3468
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:30,980
right
 

3469
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:33,730
right
this is pedestrians walking perfectly

3470
01:21:33,730 --> 01:21:33,740
this is pedestrians walking perfectly
 

3471
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:35,050
this is pedestrians walking perfectly
legally I think they have a green light

3472
01:21:35,050 --> 01:21:35,060
legally I think they have a green light
 

3473
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:37,120
legally I think they have a green light
of course there's a lot of jaywalking

3474
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:37,130
of course there's a lot of jaywalking
 

3475
01:21:37,130 --> 01:21:40,180
of course there's a lot of jaywalking
too as well well this car just slide

3476
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:40,190
too as well well this car just slide
 

3477
01:21:40,190 --> 01:21:42,460
too as well well this car just slide
it's not part of the point but yes

3478
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:42,470
it's not part of the point but yes
 

3479
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:44,230
it's not part of the point but yes
exactly there's an ambulance and so

3480
01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:44,240
exactly there's an ambulance and so
 

3481
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:46,060
exactly there's an ambulance and so
there's another car that starts making a

3482
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:46,070
there's another car that starts making a
 

3483
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:48,250
there's another car that starts making a
left turn in a little bit I may have

3484
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:48,260
left turn in a little bit I may have
 

3485
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:50,620
left turn in a little bit I may have
missed it hopefully not so yeah and then

3486
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:50,630
missed it hopefully not so yeah and then
 

3487
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:52,270
missed it hopefully not so yeah and then
there's another car after that too that

3488
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:52,280
there's another car after that too that
 

3489
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:54,400
there's another car after that too that
just illustrates when you design an

3490
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:54,410
just illustrates when you design an
 

3491
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:56,470
just illustrates when you design an
algorithm that's supposed to move

3492
01:21:56,470 --> 01:21:56,480
algorithm that's supposed to move
 

3493
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:59,020
algorithm that's supposed to move
through the space like watch this car

3494
01:21:59,020 --> 01:21:59,030
through the space like watch this car
 

3495
01:21:59,030 --> 01:22:01,780
through the space like watch this car
the aggression it shows now this isn't a

3496
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:01,790
the aggression it shows now this isn't a
 

3497
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:03,280
the aggression it shows now this isn't a
trivial example for those that try to

3498
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:03,290
trivial example for those that try to
 

3499
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:05,320
trivial example for those that try to
build robots this is this is the real

3500
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:05,330
build robots this is this is the real
 

3501
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:08,730
build robots this is this is the real
question is how do you design a system

3502
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:08,740
question is how do you design a system
 

3503
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:12,910
question is how do you design a system
that's able so you have to think you

3504
01:22:12,910 --> 01:22:12,920
that's able so you have to think you
 

3505
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:15,460
that's able so you have to think you
have to put reward functions objective

3506
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:15,470
have to put reward functions objective
 

3507
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:17,680
have to put reward functions objective
functions utility functions under which

3508
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:17,690
functions utility functions under which
 

3509
01:22:17,690 --> 01:22:19,900
functions utility functions under which
it performs the planning so a car like

3510
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:19,910
it performs the planning so a car like
 

3511
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:24,430
it performs the planning so a car like
that has several thousand candidate

3512
01:22:24,430 --> 01:22:24,440
that has several thousand candidate
 

3513
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:25,510
that has several thousand candidate
trajectories you can take that

3514
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:25,520
trajectories you can take that
 

3515
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,190
trajectories you can take that
intersection you can take a trajectory

3516
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:27,200
intersection you can take a trajectory
 

3517
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,080
intersection you can take a trajectory
where it speeds up to 60 miles an hour

3518
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:29,090
where it speeds up to 60 miles an hour
 

3519
01:22:29,090 --> 01:22:30,670
where it speeds up to 60 miles an hour
it doesn't stop and just swerves and

3520
01:22:30,670 --> 01:22:30,680
it doesn't stop and just swerves and
 

3521
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,200
it doesn't stop and just swerves and
hits everything okay that's a bad

3522
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:32,210
hits everything okay that's a bad
 

3523
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:34,030
hits everything okay that's a bad
trajectory right then there is a

3524
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:34,040
trajectory right then there is a
 

3525
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,280
trajectory right then there is a
trajectory which most companies take

3526
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:36,290
trajectory which most companies take
 

3527
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:38,590
trajectory which most companies take
which is most a Google self-driving car

3528
01:22:38,590 --> 01:22:38,600
which is most a Google self-driving car
 

3529
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:40,390
which is most a Google self-driving car
and every company that's is concerned

3530
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:40,400
and every company that's is concerned
 

3531
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:43,120
and every company that's is concerned
about PR is whenever there's any kind of

3532
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:43,130
about PR is whenever there's any kind of
 

3533
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:44,310
about PR is whenever there's any kind of
obstacle any

3534
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:44,320
obstacle any
 

3535
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,710
obstacle any
kind of risk that's it all reasonable

3536
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:46,720
kind of risk that's it all reasonable
 

3537
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,390
kind of risk that's it all reasonable
that you can maybe even touch an

3538
01:22:48,390 --> 01:22:48,400
that you can maybe even touch an
 

3539
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,070
that you can maybe even touch an
obstacle then you're not going to take

3540
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:50,080
obstacle then you're not going to take
 

3541
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,720
obstacle then you're not going to take
that trajectory so what that means is

3542
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:51,730
that trajectory so what that means is
 

3543
01:22:51,730 --> 01:22:52,860
that trajectory so what that means is
you're going to navigate to this

3544
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:52,870
you're going to navigate to this
 

3545
01:22:52,870 --> 01:22:55,380
you're going to navigate to this
intersection at 10 miles an hour and you

3546
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:55,390
intersection at 10 miles an hour and you
 

3547
01:22:55,390 --> 01:22:57,600
intersection at 10 miles an hour and you
let people abuse you by walking in front

3548
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:57,610
let people abuse you by walking in front
 

3549
01:22:57,610 --> 01:22:58,650
let people abuse you by walking in front
of you because they know you're not

3550
01:22:58,650 --> 01:22:58,660
of you because they know you're not
 

3551
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:00,660
of you because they know you're not
going to stop and so in the middle there

3552
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:00,670
going to stop and so in the middle there
 

3553
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:04,230
going to stop and so in the middle there
is hundreds thousands of trajectories

3554
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:04,240
is hundreds thousands of trajectories
 

3555
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:06,750
is hundreds thousands of trajectories
that are ethically questionable in the

3556
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:06,760
that are ethically questionable in the
 

3557
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:08,400
that are ethically questionable in the
sense that you're putting other human

3558
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:08,410
sense that you're putting other human
 

3559
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:10,620
sense that you're putting other human
beings at risk in order to safely and

3560
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:10,630
beings at risk in order to safely and
 

3561
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:12,060
beings at risk in order to safely and
successfully navigate to an intersection

3562
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:12,070
successfully navigate to an intersection
 

3563
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:14,880
successfully navigate to an intersection
and the design of those objective

3564
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:14,890
and the design of those objective
 

3565
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:17,310
and the design of those objective
functions is is the kind of question you

3566
01:23:17,310 --> 01:23:17,320
functions is is the kind of question you
 

3567
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:20,190
functions is is the kind of question you
have to ask for intelligent systems fork

3568
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:20,200
have to ask for intelligent systems fork
 

3569
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:23,970
have to ask for intelligent systems fork
for cars is there's no grandma and a few

3570
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:23,980
for cars is there's no grandma and a few
 

3571
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:25,830
for cars is there's no grandma and a few
children you have to choose who gets to

01:25:43,229 --> 01:25:43,239
can't delayed gratification this kind of
 

3681
01:25:43,239 --> 01:25:45,600
can't delayed gratification this kind of
the idea of delayed gratification in the

01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:45,610
the idea of delayed gratification in the
 

3683
01:25:45,610 --> 01:25:47,279
the idea of delayed gratification in the
case of designing intelligent system was

3684
01:25:47,279 --> 01:25:47,289
case of designing intelligent system was
 

3685
01:25:47,289 --> 01:25:49,649
case of designing intelligent system was
a huge actual serious problem and this

3686
01:25:49,649 --> 01:25:49,659
a huge actual serious problem and this
 

3687
01:25:49,659 --> 01:25:55,649
a huge actual serious problem and this
is a good illustration of that so we

3688
01:25:55,649 --> 01:25:55,659
is a good illustration of that so we
 

3689
01:25:55,659 --> 01:25:57,959
is a good illustration of that so we
flew through a few concepts here is

3690
01:25:57,959 --> 01:25:57,969
flew through a few concepts here is
 

3691
01:25:57,969 --> 01:26:01,229
flew through a few concepts here is
there any is there any questions about

3692
01:26:01,229 --> 01:26:01,239
there any is there any questions about
 

3693
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:03,450
there any is there any questions about
some of the compute and the algorithm

3694
01:26:03,450 --> 01:26:03,460
some of the compute and the algorithm
 

3695
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:05,520
some of the compute and the algorithm
side we talked about today yes

3696
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:05,530
side we talked about today yes
 

3697
01:26:05,530 --> 01:26:07,919
side we talked about today yes
so the question was yeah used you

3698
01:26:07,919 --> 01:26:07,929
so the question was yeah used you
 

3699
01:26:07,929 --> 01:26:09,740
so the question was yeah used you
highlighted some of the limitations of

3700
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:09,750
highlighted some of the limitations of
 

3701
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:12,089
highlighted some of the limitations of
machine computer vision algorithms

3702
01:26:12,089 --> 01:26:12,099
machine computer vision algorithms
 

3703
01:26:12,099 --> 01:26:14,189
machine computer vision algorithms
machine learning algorithms but you

3704
01:26:14,189 --> 01:26:14,199
machine learning algorithms but you
 

3705
01:26:14,199 --> 01:26:15,120
machine learning algorithms but you
haven't highlighted some of the

3706
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:15,130
haven't highlighted some of the
 

3707
01:26:15,130 --> 01:26:17,279
haven't highlighted some of the
limitations of human beings and if you

3708
01:26:17,279 --> 01:26:17,289
limitations of human beings and if you
 

3709
01:26:17,289 --> 01:26:19,140
limitations of human beings and if you
put those in a column and you compare

3710
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:19,150
put those in a column and you compare
 

3711
01:26:19,150 --> 01:26:21,839
put those in a column and you compare
those it's our machines doing better

3712
01:26:21,839 --> 01:26:21,849
those it's our machines doing better
 

3713
01:26:21,849 --> 01:26:23,700
those it's our machines doing better
overall or is there any kind of way to

3714
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:23,710
overall or is there any kind of way to
 

3715
01:26:23,710 --> 01:26:25,500
overall or is there any kind of way to
compare those I mean that there's

3716
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:25,510
compare those I mean that there's
 

3717
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:27,270
compare those I mean that there's
actually interesting work on image net

3718
01:26:27,270 --> 01:26:27,280
actually interesting work on image net
 

3719
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:30,270
actually interesting work on image net
so image net is this categorization task

3720
01:26:30,270 --> 01:26:30,280
so image net is this categorization task
 

3721
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:32,370
so image net is this categorization task
of where you have to classify images and

3722
01:26:32,370 --> 01:26:32,380
of where you have to classify images and
 

3723
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:34,080
of where you have to classify images and
you can ask the question when I present

3724
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:34,090
you can ask the question when I present
 

3725
01:26:34,090 --> 01:26:36,330
you can ask the question when I present
you images of cats and dogs where our

3726
01:26:36,330 --> 01:26:36,340
you images of cats and dogs where our
 

3727
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:37,919
you images of cats and dogs where our
machine is better than humans and when

3728
01:26:37,919 --> 01:26:37,929
machine is better than humans and when
 

3729
01:26:37,929 --> 01:26:40,169
machine is better than humans and when
when are they not so you can compare

3730
01:26:40,169 --> 01:26:40,179
when are they not so you can compare
 

3731
01:26:40,179 --> 01:26:42,390
when are they not so you can compare
when machines do better what are the

3732
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:42,400
when machines do better what are the
 

3733
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,009
when machines do better what are the
fail points and what are the fail points

3734
01:26:44,009 --> 01:26:44,019
fail points and what are the fail points
 

3735
01:26:44,019 --> 01:26:45,000
fail points and what are the fail points
for humans and there's a lot of

3736
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:45,010
for humans and there's a lot of
 

3737
01:26:45,010 --> 01:26:46,680
for humans and there's a lot of
interesting visual perception questions

3738
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:46,690
interesting visual perception questions
 

3739
01:26:46,690 --> 01:26:49,620
interesting visual perception questions
there I think overall it's certainly

3740
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:49,630
there I think overall it's certainly
 

3741
01:26:49,630 --> 01:26:51,600
there I think overall it's certainly
true that machines fail differently than

3742
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:51,610
true that machines fail differently than
 

3743
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:55,279
true that machines fail differently than
human beings but in order to make an

3744
01:26:55,279 --> 01:26:55,289
human beings but in order to make an
 

3745
01:26:55,289 --> 01:26:57,680
human beings but in order to make an
artificial intelligence system that's

3746
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:57,690
artificial intelligence system that's
 

3747
01:26:57,690 --> 01:27:00,979
artificial intelligence system that's
usable and could make you a lot of money

3748
01:27:00,979 --> 01:27:00,989
usable and could make you a lot of money
 

3749
01:27:00,989 --> 01:27:04,169
usable and could make you a lot of money
and people would want to use it has to

3750
01:27:04,169 --> 01:27:04,179
and people would want to use it has to
 

3751
01:27:04,179 --> 01:27:06,000
and people would want to use it has to
be better for that particular task in

3752
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:06,010
be better for that particular task in
 

3753
01:27:06,010 --> 01:27:10,169
be better for that particular task in
every single way in order in order for

3754
01:27:10,169 --> 01:27:10,179
every single way in order in order for
 

3755
01:27:10,179 --> 01:27:11,640
every single way in order in order for
you to want to use a system

3756
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:11,650
you to want to use a system
 

3757
01:27:11,650 --> 01:27:14,490
you to want to use a system
has to be it has to be superior to human

3758
01:27:14,490 --> 01:27:14,500
has to be it has to be superior to human
 

3759
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:16,229
has to be it has to be superior to human
performance and usually far superior to

3760
01:27:16,229 --> 01:27:16,239
performance and usually far superior to
 

3761
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:19,860
performance and usually far superior to
human performance so so it's on the

3762
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:19,870
human performance so so it's on the
 

3763
01:27:19,870 --> 01:27:21,030
human performance so so it's on the
philosophical level it's an interesting

3764
01:27:21,030 --> 01:27:21,040
philosophical level it's an interesting
 

3765
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,709
philosophical level it's an interesting
thing to compare what are we good at

3766
01:27:22,709 --> 01:27:22,719
thing to compare what are we good at
 

3767
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:27,360
thing to compare what are we good at
what are not but if you're using Amazon

3768
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:27,370
what are not but if you're using Amazon
 

3769
01:27:27,370 --> 01:27:30,479
what are not but if you're using Amazon
echo your voice recognition or any kind

3770
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:30,489
echo your voice recognition or any kind
 

3771
01:27:30,489 --> 01:27:33,270
echo your voice recognition or any kind
of natural language chatbots or a car

3772
01:27:33,270 --> 01:27:33,280
of natural language chatbots or a car
 

3773
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,669
of natural language chatbots or a car
you're not gonna be well this car is not

3774
01:27:35,669 --> 01:27:35,679
you're not gonna be well this car is not
 

3775
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:37,020
you're not gonna be well this car is not

regulate the shaky terrain and
 

3829
01:28:37,929 --> 01:28:41,760
