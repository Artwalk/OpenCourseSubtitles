climbing the stairways I think they were
 

185
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,979
climbing the stairways I think they were
going on a trek up and down them but I'd

00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:19,989
going on a trek up and down them but I'd
 

187
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:22,950
going on a trek up and down them but I'd
like to see the going outside so

used in the DARPA Robotics Challenge you
 

285
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,260
used in the DARPA Robotics Challenge you
have one here and and then handle which

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:40,270
have one here and and then handle which
 

287
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,390
have one here and and then handle which
is our latest version so I'll say have a

00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,400
is our latest version so I'll say have a
 

289
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,360
is our latest version so I'll say have a
few words to say about each of them so

290
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:45,370
few words to say about each of them so

00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,040
we had been developing a big dog and
those other quadrupeds that I showed you

00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,050
those other quadrupeds that I showed you
 

295
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,320
those other quadrupeds that I showed you
for quite some number of years and it

296
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,330
for quite some number of years and it
 

297
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,390
for quite some number of years and it
was amazing for us to find out when we

298
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,400
was amazing for us to find out when we
 

299
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,750
was amazing for us to find out when we
did this project on on spot this is the

300
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:57,760
did this project on on spot this is the
 

301
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,360
did this project on on spot this is the
predecessor to that that there was still

302
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:00,370
predecessor to that that there was still
 

303
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,390
predecessor to that that there was still
a lot to learn and we kind of

304
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,400
a lot to learn and we kind of
 

305
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,830
a lot to learn and we kind of
revolutionized the hardware design and

306
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:04,840
revolutionized the hardware design and
 

307
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,770
revolutionized the hardware design and
how the control worked and got a much

308
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:07,780
how the control worked and got a much
 

309
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,779
how the control worked and got a much
higher level of rough terrain

310
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:09,789
higher level of rough terrain
 

311
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:12,240
higher level of rough terrain
performance and part of the solution to

312
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,250
performance and part of the solution to
 

313
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,760
performance and part of the solution to
that was to be able to decompose the

314
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:14,770
that was to be able to decompose the
 

315
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,810
that was to be able to decompose the
control problem into many separate

00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,670
control problem into many separate
controllers that operated in different

00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:20,680
controllers that operated in different
 

319
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,400
controllers that operated in different
regions of state space and that allowed

320
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:23,410
regions of state space and that allowed
 

321
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,680
regions of state space and that allowed
us both to have programmers work on

322
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:25,690
us both to have programmers work on
 

323
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,879
us both to have programmers work on
multiple solutions to the problem and

324
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:29,889
multiple solutions to the problem and
 

325
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:32,300
multiple solutions to the problem and
also have the complexity of each

326
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:32,310
also have the complexity of each
 

327
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,100
also have the complexity of each
controller simplified by only having to

328
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,110
controller simplified by only having to
 

329
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,320
controller simplified by only having to
operate in a small part of the dynamic

00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:37,330
operate in a small part of the dynamic
 

331
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,339

here we've added a robot arm to the to

334
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:42,229
here we've added a robot arm to the to
 

335
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:46,510
here we've added a robot arm to the to
the previous version of spot and you

336
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:46,520
the previous version of spot and you
 

337
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,429
the previous version of spot and you
know we believe that mobile manipulation

338
00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:48,439
know we believe that mobile manipulation
 

339
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,020
know we believe that mobile manipulation
that is manipulation when you can move

340
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,030
that is manipulation when you can move
 

341
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:54,580
that is manipulation when you can move
the base is really a powerful way of

00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:54,590
the base is really a powerful way of
 

343
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,369
the base is really a powerful way of
doing things now this is probably the

00:07:57,369 --> 00:07:57,379
doing things now this is probably the
 

345
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:58,749
doing things now this is probably the
most important thing I want to show

346
00:07:58,749 --> 00:07:58,759
most important thing I want to show
 

347
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,429
most important thing I want to show
tonight and I'll show it three different

348
00:08:00,429 --> 00:08:00,439
tonight and I'll show it three different
 

349
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,950
tonight and I'll show it three different
times the idea that we don't build

350
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:02,960
times the idea that we don't build
 

351
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,350
times the idea that we don't build
controllers that just do one particular

352
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,360
controllers that just do one particular
 

353
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,809
controllers that just do one particular
thing but that they can determine where

354
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:07,819
thing but that they can determine where
 

355
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:09,490
thing but that they can determine where
they are in the execution here's another

356
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:09,500
they are in the execution here's another
 

357
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,980
they are in the execution here's another
version of it and then adjust what

358
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:11,990
version of it and then adjust what
 

359
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,040
version of it and then adjust what
they're doing in order to compensate for

00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,050
they're doing in order to compensate for
 

361
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,379
they're doing in order to compensate for
disturbances in the real world I know

362
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:17,389
disturbances in the real world I know
 

363
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:20,020
disturbances in the real world I know
this class is about AI and probably

364
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,030
this class is about AI and probably
 

365
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:25,330
this class is about AI and probably
autonomy I think that the one of the

366
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:25,340
autonomy I think that the one of the
 

367
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,010
autonomy I think that the one of the
most important ways of getting to

368
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:27,020
most important ways of getting to
 

369
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,140
most important ways of getting to
autonomy is to have the low level

370
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,150
autonomy is to have the low level
 

371
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,330
autonomy is to have the low level
implementations very robust to

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:31,340
implementations very robust to
 

373
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,550
implementations very robust to
disturbances so that the planning steps

00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:33,560
disturbances so that the planning steps
 

375
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,139
disturbances so that the planning steps
don't have to take care of all the

376
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:35,149
don't have to take care of all the
 

377
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:37,750
don't have to take care of all the
minutiae of the details of the real

378
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:37,760
minutiae of the details of the real
 

379
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,120
minutiae of the details of the real
world and that's what we've been trying

380
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,130
world and that's what we've been trying
 

381
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,550
world and that's what we've been trying
to do there we've been experimenting

382
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:42,560
to do there we've been experimenting
 

383
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,920
to do there we've been experimenting
with doing delivery of packages to

384
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:44,930
with doing delivery of packages to
 

385
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,620
with doing delivery of packages to
people's houses these are all employees

386
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:47,630
people's houses these are all employees
 

387
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,180
people's houses these are all employees
of Boston Dynamics so we didn't go

388
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:49,190
of Boston Dynamics so we didn't go
 

389
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:53,290
of Boston Dynamics so we didn't go
crashing ordinary people's houses and it

390
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:53,300
crashing ordinary people's houses and it
 

391
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,870
crashing ordinary people's houses and it
turns out that there's just lots of

392
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:55,880
turns out that there's just lots of
 

393
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,280
turns out that there's just lots of
different kinds of stairways and

394
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:57,290
different kinds of stairways and
 

395
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:02,259
different kinds of stairways and
entranceways and the robots doing very

396
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:02,269
entranceways and the robots doing very
 

397
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:04,389
entranceways and the robots doing very
well we're up to something between

398
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:04,399
well we're up to something between
 

399
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,269
well we're up to something between
seventy and eighty percent of of the

400
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:07,279
seventy and eighty percent of of the
 

401
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,090
seventy and eighty percent of of the
kinds of stairs and access places we

402
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:10,100
kinds of stairs and access places we
 

403
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,259
kinds of stairs and access places we
encounter after collecting data and

404
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:14,269
encounter after collecting data and
 

405
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:20,319
encounter after collecting data and
making improvements and adjustments so

406
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:20,329
making improvements and adjustments so
 

407
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:21,000
making improvements and adjustments so
I'm going to say if

408
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,010
I'm going to say if
 

409
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,550
I'm going to say if
you philosophical things or approach

410
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:23,560
you philosophical things or approach
 

411
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,720
you philosophical things or approach
things a lot of people think that this

412
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:27,730
things a lot of people think that this
 

413
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,520
things a lot of people think that this
is the model of how a computer and a

414
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:31,530
is the model of how a computer and a
 

415
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:35,510
is the model of how a computer and a
robot interact that is there's the robot

416
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:35,520
robot interact that is there's the robot
 

417
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,670
robot interact that is there's the robot
which is hardware and electronics and

418
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:38,680
which is hardware and electronics and
 

419
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,520
which is hardware and electronics and
sensors and and then there's a computer

420
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:41,530
sensors and and then there's a computer
 

421
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,100
sensors and and then there's a computer
and that the computer listens to the

422
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,110
and that the computer listens to the
 

423
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,470
and that the computer listens to the
sensors on the robot and then gives it

424
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480
sensors on the robot and then gives it
 

425
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,860
sensors on the robot and then gives it
instructions and tells it what to do and

426
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:48,870
instructions and tells it what to do and
 

427
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,660
instructions and tells it what to do and
well I think that's actually going on

428
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:51,670
well I think that's actually going on
 

429
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,330
well I think that's actually going on
there's another part to the story which

430
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:54,340
there's another part to the story which
 

431
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,250
there's another part to the story which
is that the physical world is also

432
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:56,260
is that the physical world is also
 

433
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,860
is that the physical world is also
giving instructions to the robot and

434
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:58,870
giving instructions to the robot and
 

435
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,220
giving instructions to the robot and
that means that the energy is stored in

436
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:02,230
that means that the energy is stored in
 

437
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,740
that means that the energy is stored in
the robot either in its Springs or in

438
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:04,750
the robot either in its Springs or in
 

439
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,270
the robot either in its Springs or in
its it's motion those are all important

440
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:09,280
its it's motion those are all important
 

441
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,980
its it's motion those are all important
determinants of how the robots going to

442
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:10,990
determinants of how the robots going to
 

443
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,520
determinants of how the robots going to
behave in the time coming forward and so

444
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:14,530
behave in the time coming forward and so
 

445
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,560
behave in the time coming forward and so
we like to think in terms of designing

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:16,570
we like to think in terms of designing
 

447
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,470
we like to think in terms of designing

robots and are so into the the beauty of

478
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640
robots and are so into the the beauty of
 

479
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,600
robots and are so into the the beauty of
what they've created that they kind of

480
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:09,610
what they've created that they kind of
 

481
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,780
what they've created that they kind of
put it on an altar and afraid of

482
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:11,790
put it on an altar and afraid of
 

483
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:16,350
put it on an altar and afraid of
actually hurting it so in fact I even

484
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:16,360
actually hurting it so in fact I even
 

485
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,480
actually hurting it so in fact I even
have friends here at MIT that have done

486
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:18,490
have friends here at MIT that have done
 

487
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,100
have friends here at MIT that have done
that where they have a gold-plated robot

488
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,110
that where they have a gold-plated robot
 

489
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,740
that where they have a gold-plated robot
and they're afraid of taking it out into

490
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:22,750
and they're afraid of taking it out into
 

491
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,280
and they're afraid of taking it out into
the world I mean we're just the opposite

492
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:25,290
the world I mean we're just the opposite
 

493
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,410
the world I mean we're just the opposite
every one of our robots is designed to

494
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:28,420
every one of our robots is designed to
 

495
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,110
every one of our robots is designed to
get bashed to bits we have staff who are

496
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,120
get bashed to bits we have staff who are
 

497
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,680
get bashed to bits we have staff who are
there to fix the robot on a daily basis

498
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:34,690
there to fix the robot on a daily basis
 

499
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,780
there to fix the robot on a daily basis
as we break it and I think doing that

500
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:36,790
as we break it and I think doing that
 

501
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,090
as we break it and I think doing that
build it break it fix it means that

502
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:39,100
build it break it fix it means that
 

503
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,100
build it break it fix it means that
we're able to learn a lot from the

504
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,110
we're able to learn a lot from the
 

505
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,290
we're able to learn a lot from the
actual physical robot working in the

506
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:43,300
actual physical robot working in the
 

507
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,470
actual physical robot working in the
world and we can use that knowledge in

508
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:46,480
world and we can use that knowledge in
 

509
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,360
world and we can use that knowledge in
order to improve the robot improve its

510
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:48,370
order to improve the robot improve its
 

511
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,850
order to improve the robot improve its
behavior and we really like to go around

512
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:50,860
behavior and we really like to go around
 

513
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,000
behavior and we really like to go around
that loop as quickly and as we can early

514
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,010
that loop as quickly and as we can early
 

515
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,770
that loop as quickly and as we can early
in the in the process and do it as many

516
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:58,780
in the in the process and do it as many
 

517
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,320
in the in the process and do it as many
times as we can so here's what build it

518
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:01,330
times as we can so here's what build it
 

519
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:07,230
times as we can so here's what build it
break it fix it looks like this is in

520
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:07,240
break it fix it looks like this is in
 

521
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,470
break it fix it looks like this is in
Somerville

522
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:12,480

 

523
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:26,590

our engineers this is um a Boston driver

524
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:26,600

 

525
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,330

now this robots supposed to be using its

526
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:29,340
now this robots supposed to be using its
 

527
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:36,980
now this robots supposed to be using its
visual system to avoid the trees I think

528
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:36,990
visual system to avoid the trees I think
 

529
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,420
visual system to avoid the trees I think
it might have fallen in love with this

530
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:38,430
it might have fallen in love with this
 

531
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,250
it might have fallen in love with this
tree

532
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:39,260
tree
 

533
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,930
tree
we don't purposely give them any emotion

534
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:41,940
we don't purposely give them any emotion
 

535
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,750
we don't purposely give them any emotion
but boy it's hard not to see that and

536
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:44,760
but boy it's hard not to see that and
 

537
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,020
but boy it's hard not to see that and
here's the first time we tested the the

538
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,030
here's the first time we tested the the
 

539
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:55,490
here's the first time we tested the the
push response to this robot hey did you

540
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:55,500
push response to this robot hey did you
 

541
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,030
push response to this robot hey did you
hear that

542
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:56,040
hear that
 

543
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,610
hear that
that's the new guy's car so some guy we

544
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:58,620
that's the new guy's car so some guy we
 

545
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,140
that's the new guy's car so some guy we
just started that week Trent had $5,000

546
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,150
just started that week Trent had $5,000
 

547
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,410
just started that week Trent had $5,000
which we paid for in in repairs to his a

548
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:06,420
which we paid for in in repairs to his a
 

549
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:11,720
which we paid for in in repairs to his a
vintage BMW so the last thing sort of

550
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:11,730
vintage BMW so the last thing sort of
 

551
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,810
vintage BMW so the last thing sort of
about philosophy is long-term versus

552
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:14,820
about philosophy is long-term versus
 

553
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,960
about philosophy is long-term versus
short-term you know our company is 25

554
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:17,970
short-term you know our company is 25
 

555
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,570
short-term you know our company is 25
years old and we've mostly been a

556
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:20,580
years old and we've mostly been a
 

557
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,260
years old and we've mostly been a
long-term robotics company that is we're

558
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:24,270
long-term robotics company that is we're
 

559
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,300
long-term robotics company that is we're
interested in moving the boundary

560
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:26,310
interested in moving the boundary
 

561
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,240
interested in moving the boundary
forward in what what robots can do and

562
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,250
forward in what what robots can do and
 

563
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,210
forward in what what robots can do and
we're interested in you know making it

564
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:32,220
we're interested in you know making it
 

565
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,970
we're interested in you know making it
so robots meet the dream of being the

566
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:34,980
so robots meet the dream of being the
 

567
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,240
so robots meet the dream of being the
equal or better than people and animals

568
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,250
equal or better than people and animals
 

569
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:49,960
equal or better than people and animals
but now we've started function

570
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:49,970

 

571
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:53,070

[Music]

572
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:53,080

 

573
00:13:53,080 --> 00:14:00,670

okay we still on can you hear me but

574
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:00,680
okay we still on can you hear me but
 

575
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,400
okay we still on can you hear me but
lately we've started to realize that

576
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:03,410
lately we've started to realize that
 

577
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,840
lately we've started to realize that
some of our robots have enough

578
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:04,850
some of our robots have enough
 

579
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,330
some of our robots have enough
capability that maybe it's time to try

580
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:07,340
capability that maybe it's time to try
 

581
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,190
capability that maybe it's time to try
and productize them and we will learn a

582
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:09,200
and productize them and we will learn a
 

583
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,990
and productize them and we will learn a
lot by doing that too one of the things

584
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:11,000
lot by doing that too one of the things
 

585
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,440
lot by doing that too one of the things
for instance that I've always claimed is

586
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:14,450
for instance that I've always claimed is
 

587
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,620
for instance that I've always claimed is
that we always spent a lot of money on

588
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:17,630
that we always spent a lot of money on
 

589
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,680
that we always spent a lot of money on
building our robots in them and use that

590
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:20,690
building our robots in them and use that
 

591
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,350
building our robots in them and use that
as a competitive advantage that is DARPA

592
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,360
as a competitive advantage that is DARPA
 

593
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,420
as a competitive advantage that is DARPA
was a frequent funder of us DARPA always

594
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:25,430
was a frequent funder of us DARPA always
 

595
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,650
was a frequent funder of us DARPA always
said let's take money out of the

596
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:26,660
said let's take money out of the
 

597
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,250
said let's take money out of the
equation and just figure out you know

598
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:30,260
equation and just figure out you know
 

599
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,710
equation and just figure out you know
how to get the solution and then worry

600
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:32,720
how to get the solution and then worry
 

601
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,690
how to get the solution and then worry
about getting the cost down later so I

602
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:34,700
about getting the cost down later so I
 

603
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,240
about getting the cost down later so I
always assumed and argued that once we

604
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:37,250
always assumed and argued that once we
 

605
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,530
always assumed and argued that once we
get a robot doing things that are

606
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:38,540
get a robot doing things that are
 

607
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,660
get a robot doing things that are
interesting then you can go and redesign

608
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:40,670
interesting then you can go and redesign
 

609
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,300
interesting then you can go and redesign
it to make it lower cost well we're

610
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:43,310
it to make it lower cost well we're
 

611
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,770
it to make it lower cost well we're
going we're going to test that because

612
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:44,780
going we're going to test that because
 

613
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,570
going we're going to test that because
it might not be true it might be that

614
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:46,580
it might not be true it might be that
 

615
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,100
it might not be true it might be that
we've designed ourselves into an

616
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,110
we've designed ourselves into an
 

617
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,890
we've designed ourselves into an
expensive corner and that it might be

618
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:50,900
expensive corner and that it might be
 

619
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,410
expensive corner and that it might be
too late but the robot that was showing

620
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:53,420
too late but the robot that was showing
 

621
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,870
too late but the robot that was showing
a little bit is much significantly cost

622
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:55,880
a little bit is much significantly cost
 

623
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,670
a little bit is much significantly cost
reduced from the prototype of it and

624
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:57,680
reduced from the prototype of it and
 

625
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,230
reduced from the prototype of it and
it'll be interesting to see whether we

626
00:14:59,230 --> 00:14:59,240
it'll be interesting to see whether we
 

627
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,240
it'll be interesting to see whether we
could get it down to the kind of prices

628
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,250
could get it down to the kind of prices
 

629
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,720
could get it down to the kind of prices
that are useful so this is just a

630
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:04,730
that are useful so this is just a
 

631
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,320
that are useful so this is just a
picture again of the idea of aiming long

632
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:08,330
picture again of the idea of aiming long
 

633
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:11,980
picture again of the idea of aiming long

can help and you know I'm not going to
talk about it now but if afterwards you

talk about it now but if afterwards you
 

709
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,330
talk about it now but if afterwards you
want to ask about that I can fill you in

want to ask about that I can fill you in
 

711
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,150
want to ask about that I can fill you in
a little more and I think this is really

a little more and I think this is really

to say that I wanted to have robots that
 

719

would help me take care of my my parents
 

721
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,140
would help me take care of my my parents
and older people but I realize now that

00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:11,150
and older people but I realize now that
 

723
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,090
and older people but I realize now that
it's probably going to be my children

it's probably going to be my children
 

725
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,790
it's probably going to be my children
using them to help take care of me but

726
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:15,800
using them to help take care of me but
 

727
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,160
using them to help take care of me but
you guys all you're all a little bit

729
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,040
you guys all you're all a little bit
younger and I think there'll be a time

younger and I think there'll be a time
 

731
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:24,100
younger and I think there'll be a time
when you could use robots to help make

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,730
you may think that your parents don't
want that but I think it's a complex

738
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:30,740
want that but I think it's a complex
 

739
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,430
want that but I think it's a complex

and I think there's going to be an
 

749
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,970
and I think there's going to be an
opportunity for doing something but

opportunity for doing something but
 

751

this robot can do the same sort of thing
 

857
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,560
this robot can do the same sort of thing
and if you think about it when you're

858
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:20,570
and if you think about it when you're
 

859
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,480

manipulating you really want the hand to
 

861
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,820
manipulating you really want the hand to
be stabilized in space and so you'd like

862
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:24,830
be stabilized in space and so you'd like
 

863
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,920
be stabilized in space and so you'd like
the body to be able to kind of

00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,630
the body to be able to kind of
coordinate with the hands so that you

866
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:28,640
coordinate with the hands so that you
 

867
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,669
coordinate with the hands so that you
can concentrate on what the world

868

there's a hardware platform and then

882
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:01,580
there's a hardware platform and then
 

883
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,770
there's a hardware platform and then
there's a software platform and then

884
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:04,780
there's a software platform and then
 

885
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,720
there's a software platform and then
developers third-party developers create

886
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:07,730
developers third-party developers create
 

887
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:10,299
developers third-party developers create
their own apps that use the platform so

888
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:10,309
their own apps that use the platform so
 

889
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:14,230
their own apps that use the platform so
we've made this spot so that there's a

we've made this spot so that there's a
 

891
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,690
we've made this spot so that there's a
place to mount hardware on the robot but

00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,470
there's also an API to program it
through and then there's a facility to

00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:20,480
through and then there's a facility to
 

897
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,049
through and then there's a facility to
have additional computing external to

00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:01,950

 

949
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:07,850

okay and then this is a demo of autonomy

950
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:07,860
okay and then this is a demo of autonomy
 

951
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,779
okay and then this is a demo of autonomy
here the robot has in a previous session

952
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:12,789
here the robot has in a previous session
 

953
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:15,060
here the robot has in a previous session
we've taken it around the lab this is

954
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,070
we've taken it around the lab this is
 

955
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,070
we've taken it around the lab this is
Boston Dynamics taking them around the

956
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:17,080
Boston Dynamics taking them around the
 

957
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,039
Boston Dynamics taking them around the
lab and recorded visual data that could

958
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:20,049
lab and recorded visual data that could
 

959
00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:22,169
lab and recorded visual data that could
be used for navigation and it's using

960
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:22,179
be used for navigation and it's using
 

961
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:25,200
be used for navigation and it's using
its stereo to match up features in the

962
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,210
its stereo to match up features in the
 

963
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,200
its stereo to match up features in the
environment so that it can navigate and

964
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:28,210
environment so that it can navigate and
 

965
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:31,620
environment so that it can navigate and
go where it had gone in the previous on

966
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:31,630
go where it had gone in the previous on
 

967
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,779
go where it had gone in the previous on
the previous path so there's no one

968
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:33,789
the previous path so there's no one
 

969
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:39,620
the previous path so there's no one
driving it for this it's all autonomous

970
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:39,630

 

971
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:42,510

that was outside my office every day

972
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:42,520
that was outside my office every day
 

973
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,970
that was outside my office every day
around noon the robot seems to show up

974
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:44,980
around noon the robot seems to show up
 

975
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:51,600
around noon the robot seems to show up
and I hear it pausing out there I don't

976
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:51,610
and I hear it pausing out there I don't
 

977
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,940
and I hear it pausing out there I don't
know why it turned there sometimes it

978
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:53,950
know why it turned there sometimes it
 

979
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,830
know why it turned there sometimes it
comes up with a solution that isn't in

980
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:55,840
comes up with a solution that isn't in
 

981
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,750
comes up with a solution that isn't in
here you'll see another one it comes up

982
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:57,760
here you'll see another one it comes up
 

983
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,140
here you'll see another one it comes up
with a solution that isn't quite

984
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:00,150
with a solution that isn't quite
 

985
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:03,890
with a solution that isn't quite
what you call is an optimization but it

986
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:03,900
what you call is an optimization but it
 

987
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,790
what you call is an optimization but it
does it does get a solution so we're

988
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:07,800
does it does get a solution so we're
 

989
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,740
does it does get a solution so we're
pretty excited by this we call this

990
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:09,750
pretty excited by this we call this
 

991
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,420
pretty excited by this we call this
patroller out and we're working on

992
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:11,430
patroller out and we're working on
 

993
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,040
patroller out and we're working on
developing a lot of software to support

994
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,050
developing a lot of software to support
 

995
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,590
developing a lot of software to support
it to make it so that other people can

996
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:15,600
it to make it so that other people can
 

997
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,920
it to make it so that other people can
capture a patrol route and then execute

998
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:18,930
capture a patrol route and then execute
 

999
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,380
capture a patrol route and then execute
them on a on a routine basis and then do

1000
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:21,390
them on a on a routine basis and then do
 

1001
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,510
them on a on a routine basis and then do
two other tasks while they're on the on

1002
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:23,520
two other tasks while they're on the on
 

1003
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:29,660
two other tasks while they're on the on
the patrol route Seth you're on so we're

1004
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:29,670
the patrol route Seth you're on so we're
 

1005
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:40,940
the patrol route Seth you're on so we're
at will do a demo of spot mini so for

1006
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:40,950
at will do a demo of spot mini so for
 

1007
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,490
at will do a demo of spot mini so for
these for this demo Seth's got a

1008
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:43,500
these for this demo Seth's got a
 

1009
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,270
these for this demo Seth's got a
joystick and he's telling it the speed

1010
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:47,280
joystick and he's telling it the speed
 

1011
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,370
joystick and he's telling it the speed
to go in the forward direction and

1012
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:49,380
to go in the forward direction and
 

1013
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,780
to go in the forward direction and
turning but the robots doing all its own

1014
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:52,790
turning but the robots doing all its own
 

1015
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:59,050
turning but the robots doing all its own
gate selection coordination of legs

1016
00:24:59,050 --> 00:24:59,060

 

1017
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:03,170

balance obviously so the robot has a

1018
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:03,180
balance obviously so the robot has a
 

1019
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,580
balance obviously so the robot has a
bunch of different gates it can walk

1020
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:06,590
bunch of different gates it can walk
 

1021
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:12,800
bunch of different gates it can walk
here it's doing one leg at a time it can

1022
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:12,810
here it's doing one leg at a time it can
 

1023
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,350
here it's doing one leg at a time it can
trot I know you do whatever gates you

1024
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,360
trot I know you do whatever gates you
 

1025
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:21,680
trot I know you do whatever gates you
want except he's got to use a selective

1026
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:21,690
want except he's got to use a selective
 

1027
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,110
want except he's got to use a selective
so here's trotting which is diagonal

1028
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:24,120
so here's trotting which is diagonal
 

1029
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,620
so here's trotting which is diagonal
pairs of legs it can do pacing which is

1030
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:27,630
pairs of legs it can do pacing which is
 

1031
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,270
pairs of legs it can do pacing which is
lateral pairs of legs to get working

1032
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:29,280
lateral pairs of legs to get working
 

1033
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,480
lateral pairs of legs to get working
together I have to tell you in the

1034
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:32,490
together I have to tell you in the
 

1035
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,370
together I have to tell you in the
earliest days of me being involved in

1036
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:34,380
earliest days of me being involved in
 

1037
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,390
earliest days of me being involved in
legged locomotion

1038
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:35,400
legged locomotion
 

1039
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,000
legged locomotion
I thought gait was a big deal but it's

1040
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,010
I thought gait was a big deal but it's
 

1041
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:41,210
I thought gait was a big deal but it's
really kind of a small thing and I don't

1042
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:41,220
really kind of a small thing and I don't
 

1043
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,670
really kind of a small thing and I don't
think it's central to what matters which

1044
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:43,680
think it's central to what matters which
 

1045
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,030
think it's central to what matters which
is support stability propulsion and

1046
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,040
is support stability propulsion and
 

1047
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,550
is support stability propulsion and
things like that I'm gonna wrap up

1048
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:49,560
things like that I'm gonna wrap up
 

1049
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,320
things like that I'm gonna wrap up
shortly I just thought I'd say a couple

1050
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:51,330
shortly I just thought I'd say a couple
 

1051
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:55,850
shortly I just thought I'd say a couple
of words about the mechanical side you

1052
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:55,860
of words about the mechanical side you
 

1053
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,340
of words about the mechanical side you
know the Atlas is a new version of a

1054
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:58,350
know the Atlas is a new version of a
 

1055
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,800
know the Atlas is a new version of a
humanoid I know some of you worked with

1056
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:00,810
humanoid I know some of you worked with
 

1057
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,890
humanoid I know some of you worked with
the DARPA Robotics Challenge humanoid

1058
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:02,900
the DARPA Robotics Challenge humanoid
 

1059
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,390
the DARPA Robotics Challenge humanoid
which was a big hulking thing that we

1060
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:05,400
which was a big hulking thing that we
 

1061
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,910
which was a big hulking thing that we
made and this is a much more svelte one

1062
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:07,920
made and this is a much more svelte one
 

1063
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:14,200
made and this is a much more svelte one
and the way we got there was to work on

1064
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,210
and the way we got there was to work on
 

1065
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:18,500
and the way we got there was to work on
the elements of the mechanical design to

1066
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:18,510
the elements of the mechanical design to
 

1067
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,280
the elements of the mechanical design to
take advantage of 3d printing and some

1068
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:22,290
take advantage of 3d printing and some
 

1069
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,920
take advantage of 3d printing and some
optimization and we did we focused on

1070
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:24,930
optimization and we did we focused on
 

1071
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,130
optimization and we did we focused on
two or three different things one is

1072
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:27,140
two or three different things one is
 

1073
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,840
two or three different things one is
making some of the leg parts where we

1074
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:29,850
making some of the leg parts where we
 

1075
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,600
making some of the leg parts where we
embed hydraulic pathways hydraulic

1076
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:32,610
embed hydraulic pathways hydraulic
 

1077
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:35,270
embed hydraulic pathways hydraulic
actuators places for valve mounts and

filters and things like that into the
 

1081
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,540
filters and things like that into the
leg and this is what that looks like

1082
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:38,550
leg and this is what that looks like
 

1083
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:42,350
leg and this is what that looks like
there's a single upper leg part that

1084
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:42,360
there's a single upper leg part that
 

1085
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,140
there's a single upper leg part that
incorporated about 15 or 20 different

00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,150
incorporated about 15 or 20 different
 

1087
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,480
incorporated about 15 or 20 different
separate components in the previous

1088
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:47,490
separate components in the previous
 

1089
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,980
separate components in the previous
design which made it lighter more

1090
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:48,990
design which made it lighter more
 

1091
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:52,310
design which made it lighter more
compact and higher strength to weight

1092
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:52,320
compact and higher strength to weight
 

1093
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,610
compact and higher strength to weight
ratio we also developed a hydraulic

the thing on the left are the components

1098
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:03,060
the thing on the left are the components
 

1099
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,050
the thing on the left are the components
as separate ones and we were able to

1100
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:06,060
as separate ones and we were able to
 

1101
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,120
as separate ones and we were able to
print up parts that integrated them so

1102
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,130
print up parts that integrated them so
 

1103

that there was a motor a pump inside of
 

1105
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,590
that there was a motor a pump inside of
a motor an accumulator reservoir valves

filters and those things and we shrunk

1108
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:18,510
filters and those things and we shrunk
 

1109
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,540
filters and those things and we shrunk
it down so that the robot could be

1110
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:20,550
it down so that the robot could be
 

1111
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:24,800
it down so that the robot could be
smaller and lighter and using that

1112
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:24,810
smaller and lighter and using that
 

1113
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,970
smaller and lighter and using that
approach we went from about a 375 pound

1114
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:27,980
approach we went from about a 375 pound
 

1115
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,180
approach we went from about a 375 pound
DRC robot to a 190 pound robot and then

1116
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:32,190
DRC robot to a 190 pound robot and then
 

1117
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,660
DRC robot to a 190 pound robot and then
the current one is about 165 pounds now

1118
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:35,670
the current one is about 165 pounds now
 

1119

that's not true but I'm working on it
 

1127
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,130
that's not true but I'm working on it
but it is close to my size and weight

but it is close to my size and weight
 

1129
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,490
but it is close to my size and weight
and I don't know I don't think we have

1130
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:52,500
and I don't know I don't think we have
 

1131
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:58,070
and I don't know I don't think we have

00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:16,470
go at human speeds of operation and so
 

1147
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:19,340
go at human speeds of operation and so
the robot searches for a box using its

00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:27,349
I think that I think that was the only
 

1153
00:28:27,349 --> 00:28:29,430
I think that I think that was the only
take we ever got with both robots

1154
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:29,440
take we ever got with both robots
 

1155
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,919
take we ever got with both robots
working together and you know one of the

1156
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:35,929
working together and you know one of the
 

1157
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:37,329
working together and you know one of the
problems with YouTube is everybody's

1158
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:37,339
problems with YouTube is everybody's
 

1159
00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:38,799
problems with YouTube is everybody's
already seen what you've been up to by

1160
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:38,809
already seen what you've been up to by
 

1161
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:40,209
already seen what you've been up to by
the time you get it go around to give a

1162
00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:40,219
the time you get it go around to give a
 

1163
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,279
the time you get it go around to give a
talk so I imagine most of you have seen

1164
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:42,289
talk so I imagine most of you have seen
 

1165
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:46,329
talk so I imagine most of you have seen
this but here's a parkour robot we're

1166
00:28:46,329 --> 00:28:46,339
this but here's a parkour robot we're
 

1167
00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:48,909
this but here's a parkour robot we're
working on where we've actually

1168
00:28:48,909 --> 00:28:48,919
working on where we've actually
 

1169
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:51,519
working on where we've actually
strengthened the hips so that it can do

1170
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:51,529
strengthened the hips so that it can do
 

1171
00:28:51,529 --> 00:29:07,569
strengthened the hips so that it can do
a little bit more jumping and and it's a

1172
00:29:07,569 --> 00:29:07,579
a little bit more jumping and and it's a
 

1173
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,699
a little bit more jumping and and it's a
kind of interesting that we've been

1174
00:29:09,699 --> 00:29:09,709
kind of interesting that we've been
 

1175
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:11,829
kind of interesting that we've been
interested in making a robot a little

1176
00:29:11,829 --> 00:29:11,839
interested in making a robot a little
 

1177
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:14,709
interested in making a robot a little
bit like the humanoid that has less

1178
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:14,719
bit like the humanoid that has less
 

1179
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,449
bit like the humanoid that has less
degrees of freedom fewer degrees of

1180
00:29:16,449 --> 00:29:16,459
degrees of freedom fewer degrees of
 

1181
00:29:16,459 --> 00:29:18,519
degrees of freedom fewer degrees of
freedom and the simpler and we designed

1182
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:18,529
freedom and the simpler and we designed
 

1183
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:20,769
freedom and the simpler and we designed
this robot and the ultimate version of

1184
00:29:20,769 --> 00:29:20,779
this robot and the ultimate version of
 

1185
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:23,199
this robot and the ultimate version of
this we'll have about 10 joints whereas

1186
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:23,209
this we'll have about 10 joints whereas
 

1187
00:29:23,209 --> 00:29:27,099
this we'll have about 10 joints whereas
the humanoid had 28 and have many many

1188
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:27,109
the humanoid had 28 and have many many
 

1189
00:29:27,109 --> 00:29:32,919
the humanoid had 28 and have many many
of the same capabilities we have some

1190
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:32,929
of the same capabilities we have some
 

1191
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:34,509
of the same capabilities we have some
use cases for this that I'm not going to

1192
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:34,519
use cases for this that I'm not going to
 

1193
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:37,719
use cases for this that I'm not going to
talk about today but this robot can lift

1194
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:37,729
talk about today but this robot can lift
 

1195
00:29:37,729 --> 00:29:39,939
talk about today but this robot can lift
heavy loads it has a relatively small

1196
00:29:39,939 --> 00:29:39,949
heavy loads it has a relatively small
 

1197
00:29:39,949 --> 00:29:43,569
heavy loads it has a relatively small
footprint given what its strength is so

1198
00:29:43,569 --> 00:29:43,579
footprint given what its strength is so
 

1199
00:29:43,579 --> 00:29:46,029
footprint given what its strength is so
the way things are done in logistics now

1200
00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:46,039
the way things are done in logistics now
 

1201
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:49,479
the way things are done in logistics now
is to use big robot arms that take up a

1202
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:49,489
is to use big robot arms that take up a
 

1203
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:53,019
is to use big robot arms that take up a
lot of floor area or heavy and we're

1204
00:29:53,019 --> 00:29:53,029
lot of floor area or heavy and we're
 

1205
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:55,119
lot of floor area or heavy and we're
looking at ways of using a robot like

1206
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:55,129
looking at ways of using a robot like
 

1207
00:29:55,129 --> 00:29:57,729
looking at ways of using a robot like
this one not exactly this we it's sort

this one not exactly this we it's sort
 

1209
00:29:57,739 --> 00:30:00,459
this one not exactly this we it's sort
of any evolution of this design in order

for and considerate so I'm just gonna
 

1237
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,769
for and considerate so I'm just gonna
wrap up by talking about you know I used

1238
00:30:41,769 --> 00:30:41,779
wrap up by talking about you know I used
 

1239
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:43,899
wrap up by talking about you know I used
to be a professor here and at Carnegie

1240
00:30:43,899 --> 00:30:43,909
to be a professor here and at Carnegie
 

1241
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:45,970
to be a professor here and at Carnegie
Mellon and when I was the professor

1242
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:45,980
Mellon and when I was the professor
 

1243
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,899
Mellon and when I was the professor
we used to mostly wrote papers and we

1244
00:30:49,899 --> 00:30:49,909
we used to mostly wrote papers and we
 

1245
00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:52,000
we used to mostly wrote papers and we
were excited by you know how many papers

1246
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,010
were excited by you know how many papers
 

1247
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:54,460
were excited by you know how many papers
we could write and how many people cited

1248
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:54,470
we could write and how many people cited
 

1249
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:58,450
we could write and how many people cited
them in their papers but as a company

1250
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:58,460
them in their papers but as a company
 

1251
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:02,110
them in their papers but as a company
guy instead of papers I think we count

1252
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:02,120
guy instead of papers I think we count
 

1253
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,039
guy instead of papers I think we count
YouTube hits and instead of citations

1254
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:06,049
YouTube hits and instead of citations

what sort of physics simulation like if

1310
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:45,690
what sort of physics simulation like if
 

1311
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,800
what sort of physics simulation like if
any do you have in your robots and do

1312
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:48,810
any do you have in your robots and do
 

1313
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:51,770
any do you have in your robots and do
you really think that like with the

00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:51,780
you really think that like with the
 

1315
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,690
you really think that like with the
current trend of neural networks we can

1316
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:53,700
current trend of neural networks we can
 

1317
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,400
current trend of neural networks we can
just like do end-to-end modeling of

1318
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:55,410
just like do end-to-end modeling of
 

1319
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,920
just like do end-to-end modeling of
these robots with like without any sort

1320
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:57,930
these robots with like without any sort
 

1321
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,420
these robots with like without any sort
of notion of physics but just like

1322
00:33:59,420 --> 00:33:59,430
of notion of physics but just like
 

1323
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:03,050
of notion of physics but just like
neural networks so we have simulators

1324
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:03,060
neural networks so we have simulators
 

1325
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,580
neural networks so we have simulators
that we've worked on for a long time

1326
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:04,590
that we've worked on for a long time

validated me and compare the behavior of
the simulator to the physics of ground

important for our work and we use them
 

1337
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:21,230

question rather than the idea that you
 

1355
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,720
question rather than the idea that you
start at one end you know - at least in

back lashing gears flexibility
 

1363
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:53,409
back lashing gears flexibility
you know the non rigidity in the

00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:53,419
you know the non rigidity in the
 

1365
00:34:53,419 --> 00:34:56,330
you know the non rigidity in the
components that's a big undertaking and

components that's a big undertaking and
 

1367
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:00,500
components that's a big undertaking and
usually so so distracting that you can't

1368
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:00,510
usually so so distracting that you can't
 

1369
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,120
usually so so distracting that you can't
really get on with with what you're

1370
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,130
really get on with with what you're
 

1371
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,890
really get on with with what you're
doing so I think we use experiment for

1372
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:03,900
doing so I think we use experiment for
 

1373
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,930
doing so I think we use experiment for
those subtleties and we use simulation

1374
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:05,940
those subtleties and we use simulation
 

1375
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:13,640
those subtleties and we use simulation
for bigger level dynamics questions hey

1376
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:13,650
for bigger level dynamics questions hey
 

1377
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:17,500
for bigger level dynamics questions hey
would you say mechanical concerns or

1378
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:17,510
would you say mechanical concerns or
 

1379
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:21,010
would you say mechanical concerns or
computational capability is more of a

they're equally important we we now

00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,410
they're equally important we we now
although we didn't start out this way we

1390
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:33,420
although we didn't start out this way we
 

1391
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,920
although we didn't start out this way we
now have equal strength in our groups in

1392
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:36,930
now have equal strength in our groups in
 

1393
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:39,020
now have equal strength in our groups in
the mechanical design and implementation

1394
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,030
the mechanical design and implementation
 

1395
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,350
the mechanical design and implementation
and in the software and controls and

1396
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:42,360
and in the software and controls and
 

1397
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,290
and in the software and controls and
sensing and I think you know they all

1398
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:45,300
sensing and I think you know they all
 

1399
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,510

matter I think if you try and get by

experimental time in because the things

experimental time in because the things
 

1407
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:56,330
experimental time in because the things
broken all the time so even though we

broken all the time so even though we
 

1409

are rough on our machines they mostly
 

1411
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:01,220
are rough on our machines they mostly
keep working because because we've put a

I can only the only thing we've done is
 

1505
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,520
I can only the only thing we've done is
we've done teleoperation which is not

we've done teleoperation which is not
 

1507
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:09,100
we've done teleoperation which is not
what you mean where we have a human

1508
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,110
what you mean where we have a human
 

1509
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:11,290

which is very interesting because you

which is very interesting because you
can see that that's a way of showing how

can see that that's a way of showing how
 

1515
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,880
can see that that's a way of showing how
fast the robot can be and how

1516
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:18,890
fast the robot can be and how
 

1517
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:21,160
fast the robot can be and how
coordinated it can be using a human and

really to be honest we're really
 

1539
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,110
really to be honest we're really
struggling with coming up with some

1540
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:47,120
struggling with coming up with some
 

1541

1547
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,350
your first reactor stree action and how
you make a robot safe if there's a

1548
00:38:59,350 --> 00:38:59,360
you make a robot safe if there's a
 

1549
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,390
you make a robot safe if there's a
problem don't really work very well you

1550
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:01,400
problem don't really work very well you
 

1551
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,570
problem don't really work very well you
can't freeze the robot you have to find

1552
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:04,580
can't freeze the robot you have to find
 

1553
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,900
can't freeze the robot you have to find
some you have to keep them going find a

1554
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:07,910
some you have to keep them going find a
 

1555
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,750
some you have to keep them going find a
way to get into a safer state so I think

1556
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:10,760
way to get into a safer state so I think
 

1557
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,100
way to get into a safer state so I think
having them in contact with people is

1558
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:12,110
having them in contact with people is
 

1559
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:15,490
having them in contact with people is
just going to be harder so eventually we

1560
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:15,500
just going to be harder so eventually we
 

1561
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,350
just going to be harder so eventually we
want to to help you know to carry lift

1562

00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,630
the relative rates of progress in
robotics and machine intelligence so an

1570
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:28,640
robotics and machine intelligence so an
 

1571
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,250
robotics and machine intelligence so an
economist might maybe measure it by

1572
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:30,260
economist might maybe measure it by
 

1573
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,960
economist might maybe measure it by
seeing how much money is going into

1574
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:31,970
seeing how much money is going into
 

1575
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,930
seeing how much money is going into
computing hardware versus arms and leg

1576
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:34,940
computing hardware versus arms and leg
 

1577
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,290
computing hardware versus arms and leg
sensors and actuators that kind of thing

1578
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:37,300
sensors and actuators that kind of thing
 

1579
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:43,330
sensors and actuators that kind of thing
so on one impossible scenario the the

1580
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:43,340
so on one impossible scenario the the
 

1581
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,860
so on one impossible scenario the the
machine intelligence rushes ahead and

1582
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:44,870
machine intelligence rushes ahead and
 

1583
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:48,430
machine intelligence rushes ahead and
the robots progressing more slowly

1584
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:48,440
the robots progressing more slowly
 

1585
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,750
the robots progressing more slowly
because of kind of slow build test cycle

1586
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:52,760
because of kind of slow build test cycle
 

1587
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,130
because of kind of slow build test cycle
basically it's their real-world things

1588
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:54,140
basically it's their real-world things
 

1589
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,750
basically it's their real-world things
it's not so easy to get a rapid build

1590
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:55,760
it's not so easy to get a rapid build
 

1591
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,170
it's not so easy to get a rapid build
test cycle with a robot and in and in

1592
00:39:59,170 --> 00:39:59,180
test cycle with a robot and in and in
 

1593
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,930
test cycle with a robot and in and in
the other scenario the robots more

1594
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:01,940
the other scenario the robots more
 

1595
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,190
the other scenario the robots more
advanced than the machine intelligence

1596
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:03,200
advanced than the machine intelligence
 

1597
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,080
advanced than the machine intelligence
because machine intelligence is just

1598
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,090
because machine intelligence is just
 

1599
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:07,230
because machine intelligence is just
such a conceptually difficult problem so

1600
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:07,240
such a conceptually difficult problem so
 

1601
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,520
such a conceptually difficult problem so
in one scenario the machines are telling

1602
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:09,530
in one scenario the machines are telling
 

1603
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,050
in one scenario the machines are telling
the humans what to do in the other

1604
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:11,060
the humans what to do in the other
 

1605
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:11,980
the humans what to do in the other
scenario that he

1606
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:11,990
scenario that he
 

1607
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,330
scenario that he
telling the machines watch do if you

1608
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:13,340
telling the machines watch do if you
 

1609
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,370
telling the machines watch do if you
like so do you have any kind of

1610
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:15,380
like so do you have any kind of
 

1611
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,140
like so do you have any kind of
perspective on that whole issue of them

1612
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:17,150
perspective on that whole issue of them
 

1613
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,300
perspective on that whole issue of them
is that the machine intelligence folk

1614
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:19,310
is that the machine intelligence folk
 

1615
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,859
is that the machine intelligence folk
going to rush ahead being what's the

1616
00:40:20,859 --> 00:40:20,869
going to rush ahead being what's the
 

1617
00:40:20,869 --> 00:40:23,020
going to rush ahead being what's the
guys struggling behind or the robots

1618
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:23,030
guys struggling behind or the robots
 

1619
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:25,060
guys struggling behind or the robots
going to get there before the massive

1620
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,070
going to get there before the massive
 

1621
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,290
going to get there before the massive
problem and machine intelligence gets

1622
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:26,300
problem and machine intelligence gets
 

1623
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,750
problem and machine intelligence gets
solved or maybe somewhere in the middle

1624
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:28,760
solved or maybe somewhere in the middle
 

1625
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,970
solved or maybe somewhere in the middle
I think let's see I don't know exactly

1626
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:30,980
I think let's see I don't know exactly
 

1627
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,140
I think let's see I don't know exactly
what you mean by machine intelligence

1628
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:32,150
what you mean by machine intelligence
 

1629
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:34,390
what you mean by machine intelligence
are you talking about

1630
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:34,400
are you talking about
 

1631
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,370
are you talking about
you know having Google do better search

1632
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:38,380
you know having Google do better search
 

1633
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,740
you know having Google do better search
computation in general so I start I

1634
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:41,750
computation in general so I start I
 

1635
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,030
computation in general so I start I
talked about economists measuring

1636
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:43,040
talked about economists measuring
 

1637
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,820
talked about economists measuring
sensors actuators and compute Hardware

1638
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:45,830
sensors actuators and compute Hardware
 

1639
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:48,640
sensors actuators and compute Hardware
so that's the kind of thinking about

1640
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:48,650
so that's the kind of thinking about
 

1641
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:51,040
so that's the kind of thinking about
yeah I think that it's always been a

1642
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,050
yeah I think that it's always been a
 

1643
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:53,770
yeah I think that it's always been a
misconception that the hardware

1644
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:53,780
misconception that the hardware
 

1645
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:58,420
misconception that the hardware
components by themselves constitute

1646
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:58,430
components by themselves constitute
 

1647
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:02,560
components by themselves constitute
progress in intelligence or in robot

1648
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:02,570
progress in intelligence or in robot
 

1649
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,990
progress in intelligence or in robot
behavior they're I think they're

1650
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:05,000
behavior they're I think they're
 

1651
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,640
behavior they're I think they're
important ingredients but by themselves

1652
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:06,650
important ingredients but by themselves
 

1653
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:08,440
important ingredients but by themselves
you know when I was a graduate student

1654
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:08,450
you know when I was a graduate student
 

1655
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:13,920
you know when I was a graduate student
here I can remember reading an ad for an

1656
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:13,930
here I can remember reading an ad for an
 

1657
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,630
here I can remember reading an ad for an
optical character recognition system and

1658
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:16,640
optical character recognition system and
 

1659
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,690
optical character recognition system and
what the ad said was you know we have

1660
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:19,700
what the ad said was you know we have
 

1661
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,630
what the ad said was you know we have
camera we have a thing for holding the

1662
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:22,640
camera we have a thing for holding the
 

1663
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,340
camera we have a thing for holding the
paper you're looking at all you have to

1664
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:24,350
paper you're looking at all you have to
 

1665
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,320
paper you're looking at all you have to
do is write the software so it was all

1666
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:26,330
do is write the software so it was all
 

1667
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:27,490
do is write the software so it was all
done except for you got to write the

1668
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:27,500
done except for you got to write the
 

1669
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:32,200
done except for you got to write the
software and you know it's the the whole

1670
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:32,210
software and you know it's the the whole
 

1671
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:36,040
software and you know it's the the whole
problem was there so I don't know if I'm

1672
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:36,050
problem was there so I don't know if I'm
 

1673
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,570
problem was there so I don't know if I'm
answering your question

1674
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:37,580
answering your question
 

1675
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,840
answering your question
you know robotics is hard I think it

1676
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:40,850
you know robotics is hard I think it
 

1677
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:42,430
you know robotics is hard I think it
feels like we're making progress if you

1678
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:42,440
feels like we're making progress if you
 

1679
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,230
feels like we're making progress if you
keep pushing we keep making progress

1680
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:44,240
keep pushing we keep making progress
 

1681
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,240
keep pushing we keep making progress
it's not like there's an e and the curve

1682
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,250
it's not like there's an e and the curve
 

1683
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:49,510
it's not like there's an e and the curve
that we've hit but I also think that the

1684
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:49,520
that we've hit but I also think that the
 

1685
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,520
that we've hit but I also think that the
rest of the AI world is making a good

1686
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:51,530
rest of the AI world is making a good
 

1687
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:55,210
rest of the AI world is making a good
progress too and it's fun being a part

1688
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:55,220
progress too and it's fun being a part
 

1689
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,720
progress too and it's fun being a part
of it

1690
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:57,730

 

1691
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:01,540

hi I

1692
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:01,550

 

1693
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,430

my question is mostly related to

1694
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:03,440
my question is mostly related to
 

1695
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,060
my question is mostly related to
security so since you are productizing

1696
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:07,070
security so since you are productizing
 

1697
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:10,960
security so since you are productizing
your robots now there has been research

1698
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:10,970
your robots now there has been research
 

1699
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:15,760
your robots now there has been research
on Leiter's mainly where you could spoof

1700
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:15,770
on Leiter's mainly where you could spoof
 

1701
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,500
on Leiter's mainly where you could spoof
a lidar and

1702
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:17,510
a lidar and
 

1703
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:20,410
a lidar and
and the sensor basically cannot see

1704
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:20,420
and the sensor basically cannot see
 

1705
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:24,010
and the sensor basically cannot see
anything so are you looking into that as

1706
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:24,020
anything so are you looking into that as
 

1707
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:28,320
anything so are you looking into that as
well taking into consideration these

1708
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:28,330
well taking into consideration these
 

1709
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:30,310
well taking into consideration these
awesome robots that you're building

1710
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:30,320
awesome robots that you're building
 

1711
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,010
awesome robots that you're building
could be in let's say you know defense

1712
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:33,020
could be in let's say you know defense
 

1713
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,840
could be in let's say you know defense
you know working for the defense as well

1714
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:34,850
you know working for the defense as well
 

1715
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,099
you know working for the defense as well
so those are like really harsh

1716
00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:36,109
so those are like really harsh
 

1717
00:42:36,109 --> 00:42:37,840
so those are like really harsh
environments yeah I mean these are very

1718
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:37,850
environments yeah I mean these are very
 

1719
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:41,109
environments yeah I mean these are very
hard problems you know if someone if if

1720
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:41,119
hard problems you know if someone if if
 

1721
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,780
hard problems you know if someone if if
an intelligent adversary wants to trick

1722
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:43,790
an intelligent adversary wants to trick
 

1723
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:46,690
an intelligent adversary wants to trick
the robot it's not all that hard these

1724
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:46,700
the robot it's not all that hard these
 

1725
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,940
the robot it's not all that hard these
days you know where we're working

1726
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:48,950
days you know where we're working
 

1727
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,530
days you know where we're working
probably the other end of the problem

1728
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:50,540
probably the other end of the problem
 

1729
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,840
probably the other end of the problem
you know trying to do the basics right

1730
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:52,850
you know trying to do the basics right
 

1731
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:57,280
you know trying to do the basics right
now I don't think you know I don't I

1732
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:57,290
now I don't think you know I don't I
 

1733
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:59,220
now I don't think you know I don't I
don't think robots are going to be as

1734
00:42:59,220 --> 00:42:59,230
don't think robots are going to be as
 

1735
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:01,660
don't think robots are going to be as
autonomous in a hostile environment

1736
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:01,670
autonomous in a hostile environment
 

1737
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:05,220
autonomous in a hostile environment
as as people either think or fear

1738
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:05,230
as as people either think or fear
 

1739
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:08,700
as as people either think or fear
because of how frail they'll still be

1740
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:08,710
because of how frail they'll still be
 

1741
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:15,099
because of how frail they'll still be
until we get further along hi there Hey

1742
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:15,109
until we get further along hi there Hey
 

1743
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:17,740
until we get further along hi there Hey
I want to ask about two things that are

1744
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:17,750
I want to ask about two things that are
 

1745
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:19,390
I want to ask about two things that are
going to probably play a big role in

1746
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:19,400
going to probably play a big role in
 

1747
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,720
going to probably play a big role in
adoption the first is price so if you

1748
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:22,730
adoption the first is price so if you
 

1749
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:24,580
adoption the first is price so if you
could speak to the current unit price of

1750
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:24,590
could speak to the current unit price of
 

1751
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:25,990
could speak to the current unit price of
a spot many and how that you think is

1752
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:26,000
a spot many and how that you think is
 

1753
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,690
a spot many and how that you think is
going to evolve over time and the second

1754
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:28,700
going to evolve over time and the second
 

1755
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,750
going to evolve over time and the second
is sort of consumer psychology I felt

1756
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:31,760
is sort of consumer psychology I felt
 

1757
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,560
is sort of consumer psychology I felt
like when I saw the the test at the end

1758
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:35,570
like when I saw the the test at the end
 

1759
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,180
like when I saw the the test at the end
of the robots wearing my level of

1760
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:37,190
of the robots wearing my level of
 

1761
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,800
of the robots wearing my level of
comfort with it being in my house

1762
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:38,810
comfort with it being in my house
 

1763
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:39,790
comfort with it being in my house
suddenly shot up

1764
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:39,800
suddenly shot up
 

1765
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,040
suddenly shot up
it seemed way more human so I was

1766
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,050
it seemed way more human so I was
 

1767
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:44,349
it seemed way more human so I was
thinking about what kinds of experiment

1768
00:43:44,349 --> 00:43:44,359
thinking about what kinds of experiment
 

1769
00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:45,370
thinking about what kinds of experiment
you guys were on where you what you've

1770
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:45,380
you guys were on where you what you've
 

1771
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,510
you guys were on where you what you've
thought about with respect to making

1772
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:46,520
thought about with respect to making
 

1773
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,830
thought about with respect to making
people more comfortable with robots

1774
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:47,840
people more comfortable with robots
 

1775
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:52,120
people more comfortable with robots
working around them yeah in terms of

1776
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:52,130
working around them yeah in terms of
 

1777
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,400
working around them yeah in terms of
cost all I you know we're not saying

1778
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:54,410
cost all I you know we're not saying
 

1779
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:57,130
cost all I you know we're not saying
what this thing costs yet but we will

1780
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:57,140
what this thing costs yet but we will
 

1781
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,830
what this thing costs yet but we will
later in the year we have reduced the

1782
00:43:59,830 --> 00:43:59,840
later in the year we have reduced the
 

1783
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,510
later in the year we have reduced the
cost of this by about a factor of 10

1784
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:01,520
cost of this by about a factor of 10
 

1785
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,690
cost of this by about a factor of 10
from what the first prototypes cost so

1786
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:04,700
from what the first prototypes cost so
 

1787
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:08,410
from what the first prototypes cost so
we're making progress in terms of the

1788
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:08,420
we're making progress in terms of the
 

1789
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,660
we're making progress in terms of the
psychology of robots it's been very

1790
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:10,670
psychology of robots it's been very
 

1791
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:14,560
psychology of robots it's been very
interesting to watch you know we we got

1792
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:14,570
interesting to watch you know we we got
 

1793
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:17,140
interesting to watch you know we we got
branded sort of as robot abusers because

1794
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:17,150
branded sort of as robot abusers because
 

1795
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:19,480
branded sort of as robot abusers because
we kick with our robot really what we

1796
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:19,490
we kick with our robot really what we
 

1797
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,150
we kick with our robot really what we
were doing was trying to show how good

1798
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:22,160
were doing was trying to show how good
 

1799
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,760
were doing was trying to show how good
they were at balancing and we weren't we

1800
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:24,770
they were at balancing and we weren't we
 

1801
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:26,320
they were at balancing and we weren't we
didn't think we were abusing them I have

1802
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:26,330
didn't think we were abusing them I have
 

1803
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,240
didn't think we were abusing them I have
video of me pushing on my daughter when

1804
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:28,250
video of me pushing on my daughter when
 

1805
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,830
video of me pushing on my daughter when
she's one years old and actually

1806
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:29,840
she's one years old and actually
 

1807
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,789
she's one years old and actually
knocking her over

1808
00:44:30,789 --> 00:44:30,799
knocking her over
 

1809
00:44:30,799 --> 00:44:32,739
knocking her over
but that wasn't my goal I wanted to kind

1810
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:32,749
but that wasn't my goal I wanted to kind
 

1811
00:44:32,749 --> 00:44:36,729
but that wasn't my goal I wanted to kind
of test out her her balance and I bet

1812
00:44:36,729 --> 00:44:36,739
of test out her her balance and I bet
 

1813
00:44:36,739 --> 00:44:39,009
of test out her her balance and I bet
you you know if you guys have kids or

1814
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:39,019
you you know if you guys have kids or
 

1815
00:44:39,019 --> 00:44:40,839
you you know if you guys have kids or
you're at all that you've you've done

1816
00:44:40,839 --> 00:44:40,849
you're at all that you've you've done
 

1817
00:44:40,849 --> 00:44:45,069
you're at all that you've you've done
stuff like that so but we've adjusted a

1818
00:44:45,069 --> 00:44:45,079
stuff like that so but we've adjusted a
 

1819
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:47,019
stuff like that so but we've adjusted a
little bit and so we don't usually push

1820
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:47,029
little bit and so we don't usually push
 

1821
00:44:47,029 --> 00:44:50,380
little bit and so we don't usually push
on the robots in our videos despite the

1822
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:50,390
on the robots in our videos despite the
 

1823
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:52,719
on the robots in our videos despite the
one we showed with the hockey and the

1824
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:52,729
one we showed with the hockey and the
 

1825
00:44:52,729 --> 00:44:55,559
one we showed with the hockey and the
hockey sticking hand on this thing

1826
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:55,569
hockey sticking hand on this thing
 

1827
00:44:55,569 --> 00:44:57,969
hockey sticking hand on this thing
that's why we had the banana peels as a

1828
00:44:57,969 --> 00:44:57,979
that's why we had the banana peels as a
 

1829
00:44:57,979 --> 00:45:00,429
that's why we had the banana peels as a
way to have the robot crash without us

1830
00:45:00,429 --> 00:45:00,439
way to have the robot crash without us
 

1831
00:45:00,439 --> 00:45:04,449
way to have the robot crash without us
being having our finger prints on it you

1832
00:45:04,449 --> 00:45:04,459
being having our finger prints on it you
 

1833
00:45:04,459 --> 00:45:07,749
being having our finger prints on it you
know I I guess the other data point I

1834
00:45:07,749 --> 00:45:07,759
know I I guess the other data point I
 

1835
00:45:07,759 --> 00:45:10,509
know I I guess the other data point I
have is that if you look at the likes

1836
00:45:10,509 --> 00:45:10,519
have is that if you look at the likes
 

1837
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:13,900
have is that if you look at the likes
and dislikes on our YouTube videos we

1838
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:13,910
and dislikes on our YouTube videos we
 

1839
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:16,329
and dislikes on our YouTube videos we
found a way to get the likes to dislikes

1840
00:45:16,329 --> 00:45:16,339
found a way to get the likes to dislikes
 

1841
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:20,049
found a way to get the likes to dislikes
ratio much higher by partly probably by

1842
00:45:20,049 --> 00:45:20,059
ratio much higher by partly probably by
 

1843
00:45:20,059 --> 00:45:24,279
ratio much higher by partly probably by
not looking like we're abusing the the

1844
00:45:24,279 --> 00:45:24,289
not looking like we're abusing the the
 

1845
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:26,919
not looking like we're abusing the the
robots there's probably a long way to go

1846
00:45:26,919 --> 00:45:26,929
robots there's probably a long way to go
 

1847
00:45:26,929 --> 00:45:30,059
robots there's probably a long way to go
to make these things really friendly and

1848
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:30,069
to make these things really friendly and
 

1849
00:45:30,069 --> 00:45:33,640
to make these things really friendly and
I have to admit there's a little

1850
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:33,650
I have to admit there's a little
 

1851
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:35,499
I have to admit there's a little
spirited of our cut at our company of

1852
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:35,509
spirited of our cut at our company of
 

1853
00:45:35,509 --> 00:45:38,319
spirited of our cut at our company of
being kind of you know it's fun being

1854
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:38,329
being kind of you know it's fun being
 

1855
00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:41,349
being kind of you know it's fun being
bad boys in terms of you know just make

1856
00:45:41,349 --> 00:45:41,359
bad boys in terms of you know just make
 

1857
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,019
bad boys in terms of you know just make
the robot do cool stuff and leave the

1858
00:45:44,019 --> 00:45:44,029
the robot do cool stuff and leave the
 

1859
00:45:44,029 --> 00:45:47,739
the robot do cool stuff and leave the
the emotions to others and certainly the

1860
00:45:47,739 --> 00:45:47,749
the emotions to others and certainly the
 

1861
00:45:47,749 --> 00:45:50,319
the emotions to others and certainly the
social robots that have so much going

1862
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:50,329
social robots that have so much going
 

1863
00:45:50,329 --> 00:45:55,539
social robots that have so much going
into making them cute I don't know I'm

1864
00:45:55,539 --> 00:45:55,549
into making them cute I don't know I'm
 

1865
00:45:55,549 --> 00:45:57,279
into making them cute I don't know I'm
sure we'll have marketing people working

1866
00:45:57,279 --> 00:45:57,289
sure we'll have marketing people working
 

1867
00:45:57,289 --> 00:46:01,769
sure we'll have marketing people working
on that I don't know what else to say hi

1868
00:46:01,769 --> 00:46:01,779
on that I don't know what else to say hi
 

1869
00:46:01,779 --> 00:46:04,449
on that I don't know what else to say hi
general questions so in terms of

1870
00:46:04,449 --> 00:46:04,459
general questions so in terms of
 

1871
00:46:04,459 --> 00:46:07,120
general questions so in terms of
research purpose or like practical

1872
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:07,130
research purpose or like practical
 

1873
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:08,890
research purpose or like practical
purpose so what are the reasons that we

1874
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:08,900
purpose so what are the reasons that we
 

1875
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,650
purpose so what are the reasons that we
choose to investigate on these humanoid

1876
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:11,660
choose to investigate on these humanoid
 

1877
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:15,339
choose to investigate on these humanoid
robots so it seems like it cannot run as

1878
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:15,349
robots so it seems like it cannot run as
 

1879
00:46:15,349 --> 00:46:17,799
robots so it seems like it cannot run as
fast as the cheetah and it also cannot

1880
00:46:17,799 --> 00:46:17,809
fast as the cheetah and it also cannot
 

1881
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:21,749
fast as the cheetah and it also cannot
carry as many stuff as the big dog yeah

1882
00:46:21,749 --> 00:46:21,759
carry as many stuff as the big dog yeah
 

1883
00:46:21,759 --> 00:46:24,400
carry as many stuff as the big dog yeah
you're you're basically saying that the

1884
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:24,410
you're you're basically saying that the
 

1885
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:26,079
you're you're basically saying that the
humanoids don't seem to be as practical

1886
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:26,089
humanoids don't seem to be as practical
 

1887
00:46:26,089 --> 00:46:27,969
humanoids don't seem to be as practical
in terms of functional right so is it

1888
00:46:27,969 --> 00:46:27,979
in terms of functional right so is it
 

1889
00:46:27,979 --> 00:46:30,519
in terms of functional right so is it
more efficient like like a humanoid

1890
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:30,529
more efficient like like a humanoid
 

1891
00:46:30,529 --> 00:46:32,319
more efficient like like a humanoid
robots more efficient than they start

1892
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:32,329
robots more efficient than they start
 

1893
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:35,919
robots more efficient than they start
cheetahs and the big dogs well you know

1894
00:46:35,919 --> 00:46:35,929
cheetahs and the big dogs well you know
 

1895
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:38,620
cheetahs and the big dogs well you know
the motivate so I don't have a good

1896
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:38,630
the motivate so I don't have a good
 

1897
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,919
the motivate so I don't have a good
answer the motivation for the DRC the

1898
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:41,929
answer the motivation for the DRC the
 

1899
00:46:41,929 --> 00:46:44,059
answer the motivation for the DRC the
DARPA Robotics Challenge which

1900
00:46:44,059 --> 00:46:44,069
DARPA Robotics Challenge which
 

1901
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:46,969
DARPA Robotics Challenge which
humanoid robots was to say that they

1902
00:46:46,969 --> 00:46:46,979
humanoid robots was to say that they
 

1903
00:46:46,979 --> 00:46:48,559
humanoid robots was to say that they
wanted to use robots that could go the

1904
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:48,569
wanted to use robots that could go the
 

1905
00:46:48,569 --> 00:46:53,269
wanted to use robots that could go the
places designed for humans and and so

1906
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:53,279
places designed for humans and and so
 

1907
00:46:53,279 --> 00:46:54,769
places designed for humans and and so
that's why they used the human form and

1908
00:46:54,769 --> 00:46:54,779
that's why they used the human form and
 

1909
00:46:54,779 --> 00:46:55,699
that's why they used the human form and
I think you know there's an argument

1910
00:46:55,699 --> 00:46:55,709
I think you know there's an argument
 

1911
00:46:55,709 --> 00:47:00,769
I think you know there's an argument
there it is true that the human form has

1912
00:47:00,769 --> 00:47:00,779
there it is true that the human form has
 

1913
00:47:00,779 --> 00:47:03,049
there it is true that the human form has
a lot of complexity to it because you

1914
00:47:03,049 --> 00:47:03,059
a lot of complexity to it because you
 

1915
00:47:03,059 --> 00:47:05,269
a lot of complexity to it because you
have very complicated legs in the biped

1916
00:47:05,269 --> 00:47:05,279
have very complicated legs in the biped
 

1917
00:47:05,279 --> 00:47:07,219
have very complicated legs in the biped
and they're supporting the weight of the

1918
00:47:07,219 --> 00:47:07,229
and they're supporting the weight of the
 

1919
00:47:07,229 --> 00:47:09,229
and they're supporting the weight of the
body and the arms whereas the quadrupeds

1920
00:47:09,229 --> 00:47:09,239
body and the arms whereas the quadrupeds
 

1921
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:15,859
body and the arms whereas the quadrupeds
can spread all that out so I'm

1922
00:47:15,859 --> 00:47:15,869
can spread all that out so I'm
 

1923
00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:17,359
can spread all that out so I'm
sympathetic to your question I don't

1924
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:17,369
sympathetic to your question I don't
 

1925
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:20,390
sympathetic to your question I don't
really have an answer I can tell you

1926
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:20,400
really have an answer I can tell you
 

1927
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,729
really have an answer I can tell you
that the public's reaction to a humanoid

1928
00:47:22,729 --> 00:47:22,739
that the public's reaction to a humanoid
 

1929
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:26,029
that the public's reaction to a humanoid
robot is off the scale compared to

1930
00:47:26,029 --> 00:47:26,039
robot is off the scale compared to
 

1931
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:27,979
robot is off the scale compared to
anything we've done with Quadra Petro

1932
00:47:27,979 --> 00:47:27,989
anything we've done with Quadra Petro
 

1933
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:31,670
anything we've done with Quadra Petro
BOTS for what that's worth so we always

1934
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:31,680
BOTS for what that's worth so we always
 

1935
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,979
BOTS for what that's worth so we always
get a lot of viewership if we show a

1936
00:47:33,979 --> 00:47:33,989
get a lot of viewership if we show a
 

1937
00:47:33,989 --> 00:47:37,160
get a lot of viewership if we show a
humanoid doing something but I think

1938
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:37,170
humanoid doing something but I think
 

1939
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:38,359
humanoid doing something but I think
it's a question that we will keep

1940
00:47:38,359 --> 00:47:38,369
it's a question that we will keep
 

1941
00:47:38,369 --> 00:47:40,640
it's a question that we will keep
addressing we are going to keep pushing

1942
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:40,650
addressing we are going to keep pushing
 

1943
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,859
addressing we are going to keep pushing
on getting the humanoid to do more and

1944
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:42,869
on getting the humanoid to do more and
 

1945
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:45,799
on getting the humanoid to do more and
more human-like things even though we

1946
00:47:45,799 --> 00:47:45,809
more human-like things even though we
 

1947
00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:47,299
more human-like things even though we
probably won't commercialize them as

1948
00:47:47,299 --> 00:47:47,309
probably won't commercialize them as
 

1949
00:47:47,309 --> 00:47:51,549
probably won't commercialize them as
soon as we commercialize the other stuff

1950
00:47:51,549 --> 00:47:51,559

 

1951
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:54,349

how do you specify goals and although

1952
00:47:54,349 --> 00:47:54,359
how do you specify goals and although
 

1953
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:56,269
how do you specify goals and although
you said earlier that it's expensive to

1954
00:47:56,269 --> 00:47:56,279
you said earlier that it's expensive to
 

1955
00:47:56,279 --> 00:47:57,499
you said earlier that it's expensive to
do like simulations and stuff

1956
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:57,509
do like simulations and stuff
 

1957
00:47:57,509 --> 00:47:59,630
do like simulations and stuff
do you have any intentions of doing any

1958
00:47:59,630 --> 00:47:59,640
do you have any intentions of doing any
 

1959
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,459
do you have any intentions of doing any
deep reinforcement learning what was the

1960
00:48:01,459 --> 00:48:01,469
deep reinforcement learning what was the
 

1961
00:48:01,469 --> 00:48:03,019
deep reinforcement learning what was the
last thing I do you have any intentions

1962
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:03,029
last thing I do you have any intentions
 

1963
00:48:03,029 --> 00:48:07,779
last thing I do you have any intentions
of doing deep reinforcement learning

1964
00:48:07,779 --> 00:48:07,789

 

1965
00:48:07,789 --> 00:48:12,620

I'll do the last one first we I'm sure

1966
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:12,630
I'll do the last one first we I'm sure
 

1967
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:15,949
I'll do the last one first we I'm sure
we will use learning before too long I'm

1968
00:48:15,949 --> 00:48:15,959
we will use learning before too long I'm
 

1969
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:17,209
we will use learning before too long I'm
not sure whether it'll be deep

1970
00:48:17,209 --> 00:48:17,219
not sure whether it'll be deep
 

1971
00:48:17,219 --> 00:48:19,069
not sure whether it'll be deep
reinforcement learning or something else

1972
00:48:19,069 --> 00:48:19,079
reinforcement learning or something else
 

1973
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:21,759
reinforcement learning or something else
but mostly we're interested in

1974
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:21,769
but mostly we're interested in
 

1975
00:48:21,769 --> 00:48:25,549
but mostly we're interested in
optimizing the complicated state space

1976
00:48:25,549 --> 00:48:25,559
optimizing the complicated state space
 

1977
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:29,630
optimizing the complicated state space
partitioning we do right now we use you

1978
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:29,640
partitioning we do right now we use you
 

1979
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,870
partitioning we do right now we use you
know people make very simple decisions

1980
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:32,880
know people make very simple decisions
 

1981
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,969
know people make very simple decisions
as to how to divide up the space and we

1982
00:48:34,969 --> 00:48:34,979
as to how to divide up the space and we
 

1983
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:35,930
as to how to divide up the space and we
think that these things could probably

1984
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:35,940
think that these things could probably
 

1985
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:40,009
think that these things could probably
be really improved if we use the

1986
00:48:40,009 --> 00:48:40,019
be really improved if we use the
 

1987
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:41,299
be really improved if we use the
learning approach so that's probably the

1988
00:48:41,299 --> 00:48:41,309
learning approach so that's probably the
 

1989
00:48:41,309 --> 00:48:43,039
learning approach so that's probably the
first place we will apply it we do a

1990
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:43,049
first place we will apply it we do a
 

1991
00:48:43,049 --> 00:48:44,390
first place we will apply it we do a
little bit of learning here and there

1992
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:44,400
little bit of learning here and there
 

1993
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,430
little bit of learning here and there
but not much compared to how much

1994
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:46,440
but not much compared to how much
 

1995
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,529
but not much compared to how much
learning is talking about out there what

1996
00:48:48,529 --> 00:48:48,539
learning is talking about out there what
 

1997
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:50,639
learning is talking about out there what
was the other question

1998
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:50,649
was the other question
 

1999
00:48:50,649 --> 00:48:53,799
was the other question
how do we specify a goal you mean to the

2000
00:48:53,799 --> 00:48:53,809
how do we specify a goal you mean to the
 

2001
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:55,629
how do we specify a goal you mean to the
robot or how do we decide as a company

2002
00:48:55,629 --> 00:48:55,639
robot or how do we decide as a company
 

2003
00:48:55,639 --> 00:49:01,299
robot or how do we decide as a company
so I don't think there's any

2004
00:49:01,299 --> 00:49:01,309
so I don't think there's any
 

2005
00:49:01,309 --> 00:49:03,789
so I don't think there's any
across-the-board answer we write

2006
00:49:03,789 --> 00:49:03,799
across-the-board answer we write
 

2007
00:49:03,799 --> 00:49:06,669
across-the-board answer we write
applications for instant for each of

2008
00:49:06,669 --> 00:49:06,679
applications for instant for each of
 

2009
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:10,209
applications for instant for each of
these uses so for instance in the where

2010
00:49:10,209 --> 00:49:10,219
these uses so for instance in the where
 

2011
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:11,889
these uses so for instance in the where
we were doing the patrol route we have

2012
00:49:11,889 --> 00:49:11,899
we were doing the patrol route we have
 

2013
00:49:11,899 --> 00:49:14,469
we were doing the patrol route we have
an application that has a UI that lets

2014
00:49:14,469 --> 00:49:14,479
an application that has a UI that lets
 

2015
00:49:14,479 --> 00:49:16,569
an application that has a UI that lets
the user you know tell it the

2016
00:49:16,569 --> 00:49:16,579
the user you know tell it the
 

2017
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:18,759
the user you know tell it the
information it needs it can tell it to

2018
00:49:18,759 --> 00:49:18,769
information it needs it can tell it to
 

2019
00:49:18,769 --> 00:49:21,519
information it needs it can tell it to
go ahead and start on the patrol and

2020
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:21,529
go ahead and start on the patrol and
 

2021
00:49:21,529 --> 00:49:25,359
go ahead and start on the patrol and
things like that for for the door I

2022
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:25,369
things like that for for the door I
 

2023
00:49:25,369 --> 00:49:28,689
things like that for for the door I
think I think there's a button on the on

2024
00:49:28,689 --> 00:49:28,699
think I think there's a button on the on
 

2025
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,399
think I think there's a button on the on
the controller we can show you

2026
00:49:30,399 --> 00:49:30,409
the controller we can show you
 

2027
00:49:30,409 --> 00:49:33,219
the controller we can show you
afterwards if you want and you walk the

2028
00:49:33,219 --> 00:49:33,229
afterwards if you want and you walk the
 

2029
00:49:33,229 --> 00:49:35,139
afterwards if you want and you walk the
robot up to the door were you steering

2030
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:35,149
robot up to the door were you steering
 

2031
00:49:35,149 --> 00:49:36,999
robot up to the door were you steering
it and then you press the button and

2032
00:49:36,999 --> 00:49:37,009
it and then you press the button and
 

2033
00:49:37,009 --> 00:49:38,169
it and then you press the button and
then it starts looking for the door

2034
00:49:38,169 --> 00:49:38,179
then it starts looking for the door
 

2035
00:49:38,179 --> 00:49:40,029
then it starts looking for the door
handle and it goes through the hole you

2036
00:49:40,029 --> 00:49:40,039
handle and it goes through the hole you
 

2037
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:45,189
handle and it goes through the hole you
know goes through the door but I don't

2038
00:49:45,189 --> 00:49:45,199
know goes through the door but I don't
 

2039
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:46,659
know goes through the door but I don't
think these answers are fundamental I

2040
00:49:46,659 --> 00:49:46,669
think these answers are fundamental I
 

2041
00:49:46,669 --> 00:49:47,769
think these answers are fundamental I
think you could do it lots of different

2042
00:49:47,769 --> 00:49:47,779
think you could do it lots of different
 

2043
00:49:47,779 --> 00:49:48,249
think you could do it lots of different
ways

2044
00:49:48,249 --> 00:49:48,259
ways
 

2045
00:49:48,259 --> 00:49:50,049
ways
you know we're working on all the

2046
00:49:50,049 --> 00:49:50,059
you know we're working on all the
 

2047
00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:52,569
you know we're working on all the
machinery coming up from the bottom to

2048
00:49:52,569 --> 00:49:52,579
machinery coming up from the bottom to
 

2049
00:49:52,579 --> 00:49:54,669
machinery coming up from the bottom to
be able to do these things and then you

2050
00:49:54,669 --> 00:49:54,679
be able to do these things and then you
 

2051
00:49:54,679 --> 00:49:55,989
be able to do these things and then you
know in some case you could have it be

2052
00:49:55,989 --> 00:49:55,999
know in some case you could have it be
 

2053
00:49:55,999 --> 00:49:59,109
know in some case you could have it be
buttons on an 8 on a UI it could be an

2054
00:49:59,109 --> 00:49:59,119
buttons on an 8 on a UI it could be an
 

2055
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,119
buttons on an 8 on a UI it could be an
API that's accessed through some

2056
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:01,129
API that's accessed through some
 

2057
00:50:01,129 --> 00:50:04,139
API that's accessed through some
higher-level ai and we just aren't

2058
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:04,149
higher-level ai and we just aren't
 

2059
00:50:04,149 --> 00:50:08,489
higher-level ai and we just aren't
sweating that part of it at this point

2060
00:50:08,489 --> 00:50:08,499

 

2061
00:50:08,499 --> 00:50:13,029

hi so aside from locomotion I can use my

2062
00:50:13,029 --> 00:50:13,039
hi so aside from locomotion I can use my
 

2063
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:15,189
hi so aside from locomotion I can use my
body for like you know nonverbal

2064
00:50:15,189 --> 00:50:15,199
body for like you know nonverbal
 

2065
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:16,629
body for like you know nonverbal
communication to communicate my

2066
00:50:16,629 --> 00:50:16,639
communication to communicate my
 

2067
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:17,949
communication to communicate my
intentions and and other such things

2068
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:17,959
intentions and and other such things
 

2069
00:50:17,959 --> 00:50:19,589
intentions and and other such things
even though I'm not always aware of it

2070
00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:19,599
even though I'm not always aware of it
 

2071
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,589
even though I'm not always aware of it
and I guess I'm wondering if this is

2072
00:50:23,589 --> 00:50:23,599
and I guess I'm wondering if this is
 

2073
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,149
and I guess I'm wondering if this is
something that you've considered for

2074
00:50:25,149 --> 00:50:25,159
something that you've considered for
 

2075
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:27,459
something that you've considered for
these robots I think the closest we've

2076
00:50:27,459 --> 00:50:27,469
these robots I think the closest we've
 

2077
00:50:27,469 --> 00:50:29,169
these robots I think the closest we've
come is having the robot go like this

2078
00:50:29,169 --> 00:50:29,179
come is having the robot go like this
 

2079
00:50:29,179 --> 00:50:31,569
come is having the robot go like this
after the flip which was a way of

2080
00:50:31,569 --> 00:50:31,579
after the flip which was a way of
 

2081
00:50:31,579 --> 00:50:34,209
after the flip which was a way of
communicating we really haven't been

2082
00:50:34,209 --> 00:50:34,219
communicating we really haven't been
 

2083
00:50:34,219 --> 00:50:36,519
communicating we really haven't been
anything along those lines I'll bet you

2084
00:50:36,519 --> 00:50:36,529
anything along those lines I'll bet you
 

2085
00:50:36,529 --> 00:50:38,859
anything along those lines I'll bet you
though the people writing code can

2086
00:50:38,859 --> 00:50:38,869
though the people writing code can
 

2087
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,299
though the people writing code can
interpret a lot of the subtleties of

2088
00:50:40,299 --> 00:50:40,309
interpret a lot of the subtleties of
 

2089
00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:42,309
interpret a lot of the subtleties of
what's you know what's working and what

2090
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:42,319
what's you know what's working and what
 

2091
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:44,079
what's you know what's working and what
isn't by looking at things like that but

2092
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:44,089
isn't by looking at things like that but
 

2093
00:50:44,089 --> 00:50:46,149
isn't by looking at things like that but
the robot isn't trying to communicate

2094
00:50:46,149 --> 00:50:46,159
the robot isn't trying to communicate
 

2095
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:50,820
the robot isn't trying to communicate
that way

2096
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:50,830

 

2097
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:57,780

I have two questions um how do you make

2098
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:57,790
I have two questions um how do you make
 

2099
00:50:57,790 --> 00:50:59,850
I have two questions um how do you make
the robots really how do you make the

2100
00:50:59,850 --> 00:50:59,860
the robots really how do you make the
 

2101
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,340
the robots really how do you make the
robots really fast how do we make them

2102
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:02,350
robots really fast how do we make them
 

2103
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:07,620
robots really fast how do we make them
fast no my question is how did you make

2104
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:07,630
fast no my question is how did you make
 

2105
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:15,150
fast no my question is how did you make
them fast I mean like the time how we

2106
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:15,160
them fast I mean like the time how we
 

2107
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,330
them fast I mean like the time how we
get a lot of people who are really smart

2108
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:18,340
get a lot of people who are really smart
 

2109
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:21,270
get a lot of people who are really smart
and good at working together with each

2110
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:21,280
and good at working together with each
 

2111
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,290
and good at working together with each
other at our lab and then they make

2112
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:25,300
other at our lab and then they make
 

2113
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:29,280
other at our lab and then they make
plans and we everybody tries to stay on

2114
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:29,290
plans and we everybody tries to stay on
 

2115
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:32,520
plans and we everybody tries to stay on
the plan and then you know pull it

2116
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:32,530
the plan and then you know pull it
 

2117
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:35,310
the plan and then you know pull it
together sometimes it doesn't go as fast

2118
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:35,320
together sometimes it doesn't go as fast
 

2119
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,800
together sometimes it doesn't go as fast
as we like especially if we have to buy

2120
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:37,810
as we like especially if we have to buy
 

2121
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:40,260
as we like especially if we have to buy
parts from someone else and they're slow

2122
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:40,270
parts from someone else and they're slow
 

2123
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:43,860
parts from someone else and they're slow
that happens a lot no honestly is that

2124
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:43,870
that happens a lot no honestly is that
 

2125
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:47,430
that happens a lot no honestly is that
what you mean so we don't make them that

2126
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:47,440
what you mean so we don't make them that
 

2127
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,100
what you mean so we don't make them that
fast you know we're pretty fast you know

2128
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:50,110
fast you know we're pretty fast you know
 

2129
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:52,980
fast you know we're pretty fast you know
usually four or five months to build a

2130
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:52,990
usually four or five months to build a
 

2131
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:58,200
usually four or five months to build a
new robot something like that but mostly

2132
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:58,210
new robot something like that but mostly
 

2133
00:51:58,210 --> 00:51:59,340
new robot something like that but mostly
it's getting people to work together

2134
00:51:59,340 --> 00:51:59,350
it's getting people to work together
 

2135
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:02,910
it's getting people to work together
what's it what's the other question dad

2136
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:02,920
what's it what's the other question dad
 

2137
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,480
what's it what's the other question dad
that question is why do the people push

2138
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:06,490
that question is why do the people push
 

2139
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:10,100
that question is why do the people push
the robots why did it why do they push

2140
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:10,110
the robots why did it why do they push
 

2141
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:15,060
the robots why did it why do they push
why do they push we're trying the robots

2142
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:15,070
why do they push we're trying the robots
 

2143
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:17,520
why do they push we're trying the robots
are always balancing them themselves and

2144
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:17,530
are always balancing them themselves and
 

2145
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:19,950
are always balancing them themselves and
so we want to show that they're that

2146
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:19,960
so we want to show that they're that
 

2147
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:23,880
so we want to show that they're that
they can balance by by showing that when

2148
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:23,890
they can balance by by showing that when
 

2149
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,800
they can balance by by showing that when
you knock them they still they don't

2150
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:25,810
you knock them they still they don't
 

2151
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:28,200
you knock them they still they don't
fall over they stay up on their feet so

2152
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:28,210
fall over they stay up on their feet so
 

2153
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:32,310
fall over they stay up on their feet so
we're kind of showing off

2154
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:32,320

 

2155
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:36,150

are you building anything why not I

2156
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:36,160
are you building anything why not I
 

2157
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:40,840
are you building anything why not I
don't know you should um let's way off

2158
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:40,850
don't know you should um let's way off
 

2159
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:47,530
don't know you should um let's way off
why way off where is the base I'm not

2160
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:47,540
why way off where is the base I'm not
 

2161
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:51,370
why way off where is the base I'm not
good at building no yes yes you are you

2162
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:51,380
good at building no yes yes you are you
 

2163
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,020
good at building no yes yes you are you
might think you're not well some games

2164
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:53,030
might think you're not well some games
 

2165
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:56,170
might think you're not well some games
there are you had to give it a try and

2166
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:56,180
there are you had to give it a try and
 

2167
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,370
there are you had to give it a try and
you're the right a you're the right age

2168
00:52:57,370 --> 00:52:57,380
you're the right a you're the right age
 

2169
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,640
you're the right a you're the right age
to get started I'm six and a half

2170
00:52:59,640 --> 00:52:59,650
to get started I'm six and a half
 

2171
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:05,940
to get started I'm six and a half
perfect

2172
