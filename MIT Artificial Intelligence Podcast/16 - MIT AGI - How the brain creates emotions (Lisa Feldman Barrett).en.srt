circuit some other circuits too you have

418
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:28,529
circuit some other circuits too you have
 

419
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:30,829
circuit some other circuits too you have
them we all have them all neurotypical

420

brains have them and actually other

422
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:32,820
brains have them and actually other
 

423
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,230
brains have them and actually other
animals have them too and the idea is

424
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
animals have them too and the idea is
 

425
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,420
animals have them too and the idea is
that when you know one of these circuits

426
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:38,430
that when you know one of these circuits
 

427
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,970
that when you know one of these circuits
is triggered you have an emotional

428
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:40,980
is triggered you have an emotional
 

429
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,090
is triggered you have an emotional
response which is obligatory so you have

430
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:44,100
response which is obligatory so you have
 

431
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,210
response which is obligatory so you have
a very stereotypic

your breathing changes in a stereotypic
 

435
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,259
your breathing changes in a stereotypic
way your you know heart rate changes

436
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:51,269
way your you know heart rate changes
 

437
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:55,250
way your you know heart rate changes
your the chemicals in your body change

438
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:55,260
your the chemicals in your body change
 

439
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,509
your the chemicals in your body change
in a particular way you make a

440
00:09:56,509 --> 00:09:56,519
in a particular way you make a
 

441
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:59,439
in a particular way you make a
particular facial expression and you are

442
00:09:59,439 --> 00:09:59,449
particular facial expression and you are
 

443
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:02,059
particular facial expression and you are
have a propensity to make a particular

444
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:02,069
have a propensity to make a particular
 

445
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:05,059
have a propensity to make a particular
action like you you know attack and

446
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:05,069
action like you you know attack and
 

447
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:07,759
action like you you know attack and
anger and you run in fear or you freeze

448

anger and you run in fear or you freeze
 

449
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:11,329
anger and you run in fear or you freeze
in fear and then there's another view

450
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:11,339
in fear and then there's another view
 

451
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:15,530
in fear and then there's another view
which says well there are some basic

452
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:15,540
which says well there are some basic
 

453
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,629
which says well there are some basic
kind of ingredients or building blocks

454

kind of ingredients or building blocks
 

455

00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:22,940
now people talk about the brain now
 

459
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,309
now people talk about the brain now
there are some basic ingredients that

460
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:25,319
there are some basic ingredients that
 

461
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:28,009
there are some basic ingredients that
your brain uses and it uses them to make

462
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:28,019
your brain uses and it uses them to make
 

463
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,629
your brain uses and it uses them to make
every kind of mental event that you

464
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:29,639
every kind of mental event that you
 

465
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:31,220
every kind of mental event that you
experience and every action that you

466
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:31,230
experience and every action that you
 

467
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,759
experience and every action that you
take the recipes are what are unique the

468
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:34,769
take the recipes are what are unique the
 

469
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:37,189
take the recipes are what are unique the
ingredients are common right just like

470
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:37,199
ingredients are common right just like
 

471
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:39,079
ingredients are common right just like
you can take flour and water and salt

472
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:39,089
you can take flour and water and salt
 

473
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:40,189
you can take flour and water and salt
and you can make a whole bunch of

474
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:40,199
and you can make a whole bunch of
 

475
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:42,079
and you can make a whole bunch of
different recipes with them some of

476
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:42,089
different recipes with them some of
 

477
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:45,769
different recipes with them some of
which aren't even food like glue in a

similar way the idea is that your brain
 

481
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,059
similar way the idea is that your brain
has some kind of all-purpose capacities

00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:16,270
it's not just a matter of changing the
 

645
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:20,040
it's not just a matter of changing the
label of something it's actually the

label of something it's actually the
 

647
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,960
label of something it's actually the
formation of the experience is very

00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,590
different so if you want to build an

to endow it with you need to endow it
 

657
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,610
to endow it with you need to endow it
with these basic ingredients that it can

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:09,370
basic ingredients that we can understand
 

685
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,700
basic ingredients that we can understand
so I mean I think the first thing to

686
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:11,710
so I mean I think the first thing to
 

687
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:15,270
so I mean I think the first thing to
understand is that when we think about

688
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:15,280
understand is that when we think about
 

689
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,210
understand is that when we think about
building an intelligent agent we think

690
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:18,220
building an intelligent agent we think
 

691
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,970
building an intelligent agent we think
about endowing the agent with cognition

692
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:20,980
about endowing the agent with cognition
 

693
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,780
about endowing the agent with cognition
or with emotion or with the ability to

know they have different ways of parsing
 

709
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,430
know they have different ways of parsing
things but the truth is that your brain

things but the truth is that your brain
 

711
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:49,000
things but the truth is that your brain
did not evolve so that you could think

did not evolve so that you could think

getting additional resources now that
 

729
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,500
getting additional resources now that
may sound really trivial but it turns

730
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:23,510
may sound really trivial but it turns
 

731
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,260
may sound really trivial but it turns
out it's actually really hard and

732
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:25,270
out it's actually really hard and
 

733
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,160
out it's actually really hard and
scientists actually haven't really

734
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,170
scientists actually haven't really
 

735
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,770
scientists actually haven't really
figured out completely how brains do

736
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:29,780
figured out completely how brains do
 

737
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,770
figured out completely how brains do
this I mean what's really interesting to

738
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:32,780
this I mean what's really interesting to
 

739
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,290
this I mean what's really interesting to
me is that if you look for example at

740
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:35,300
me is that if you look for example at
 

741
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,940
me is that if you look for example at
computer vision try to figure out you

742
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:36,950
computer vision try to figure out you
 

743
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:41,830
computer vision try to figure out you
know how how to make an agent see that's

744
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:41,840
know how how to make an agent see that's
 

745
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,510
know how how to make an agent see that's
a pretty much solved problem not

a pretty much solved problem not
completely it's a pretty much solved

problem the basics are solved it's your
 

751
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,600
problem the basics are solved it's your
perception problems yeah the peer

752
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:49,610
perception problems yeah the peer
 

753
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,970
perception problems yeah the peer
perception problem however if you want

754
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:51,980
perception problem however if you want
 

755
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,390
perception problem however if you want
to create an agent that just reaches out

756
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:55,400
to create an agent that just reaches out
 

757
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,840

movement which we think of as this
 

765
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,750
movement which we think of as this
really basic thing like oh it's so

00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:07,760
really basic thing like oh it's so
 

767
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,900
really basic thing like oh it's so
trivial all animals can do it is

00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:16,150
actually the heart at one of the hardest
problems to solve and the brains

00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160
problems to solve and the brains
 

773
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,640
problems to solve and the brains
basically I mean there's a whole story

774
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:18,650
basically I mean there's a whole story
 

775
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,560
basically I mean there's a whole story
here about evolution which has nothing

00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:20,570
here about evolution which has nothing
 

777
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,420
here about evolution which has nothing
to do with having a lizard brain which

778
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:22,430
to do with having a lizard brain which
 

779
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,910
to do with having a lizard brain which
is wrapped in you know a cognitive brain

780
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:24,920
is wrapped in you know a cognitive brain
 

781
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,690
is wrapped in you know a cognitive brain
or anything like that that's a reference

782
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:28,700
or anything like that that's a reference
 

783
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,430
or anything like that that's a reference
to the Trion brain which a lot of people

784
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:30,440
to the Trion brain which a lot of people
 

785
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,260
to the Trion brain which a lot of people
believe it's a way of thinking about

786
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:32,270
believe it's a way of thinking about
 

787
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,160
believe it's a way of thinking about
brain evolution instead what we what

788
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,170
brain evolution instead what we what
 

789
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,200
brain evolution instead what we what
seems to be the case is that as bodies

790
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,210
seems to be the case is that as bodies
 

791
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,150
seems to be the case is that as bodies
got larger

792
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:40,160
got larger
 

793
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,420
got larger
and there were more systems because the

794
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:43,430
and there were more systems because the
 

795
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,340
and there were more systems because the
nish of the animal the environment the

nish of the animal the environment the
 

797
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,690
nish of the animal the environment the
animal got bigger and bigger and bigger

798
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:46,700
animal got bigger and bigger and bigger
 

799
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,510
animal got bigger and bigger and bigger
brains also had to get bigger but they

800
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:49,520
brains also had to get bigger but they
 

801
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,600
brains also had to get bigger but they
had to get bigger to a point with some

802
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:52,610
had to get bigger to a point with some

studying to build AI systems don't
 

941
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,750
studying to build AI systems don't
realize is that the brain its

942
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:54,760

right so maybe you can elaborate like in
 

961
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,740
right so maybe you can elaborate like in
the book sapiens that we as human beings

00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:29,750
the book sapiens that we as human beings
 

963
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,700
the book sapiens that we as human beings
are really good on mass as a thousands

964
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:33,710
are really good on mass as a thousands
 

965
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,380
are really good on mass as a thousands
millions of people together believing

966
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:35,390
millions of people together believing
 

967
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:39,700
millions of people together believing
something even if it's not true so

968
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:39,710
something even if it's not true so
 

969
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,610
something even if it's not true so
while scientifically sort of from a

970
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:42,620
while scientifically sort of from a
 

971
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,500
while scientifically sort of from a
neuroscience perspective it may be very

972
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:44,510
neuroscience perspective it may be very
 

973
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,870
neuroscience perspective it may be very
true that emotions aren't real I didn't

974
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:46,880
true that emotions aren't real I didn't
 

975
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,049
true that emotions aren't real I didn't
think real but I said they're not there

976
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:50,059
think real but I said they're not there
 

977
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,720
think real but I said they're not there
there isn't so interesting you finished

978
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:52,730
there isn't so interesting you finished
 

979
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,850
there isn't so interesting you finished
yeah yeah so what I'm trying to say is

980
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:54,860
yeah yeah so what I'm trying to say is
 

981
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,560
yeah yeah so what I'm trying to say is
also from AI perspective is they become

982
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:58,570
also from AI perspective is they become
 

983
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:02,320
also from AI perspective is they become
these trivial ideas of mapping a smile

984
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,330
these trivial ideas of mapping a smile
 

985
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:04,480
these trivial ideas of mapping a smile
to being happy and these kind of trivial

986
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:04,490
to being happy and these kind of trivial
 

987
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,240
to being happy and these kind of trivial
ideas become real to us through

988
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,250
ideas become real to us through
 

989
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,519
ideas become real to us through
Hollywood through cultural spreading of

990
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:09,529
Hollywood through cultural spreading of
 

991
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:11,320
Hollywood through cultural spreading of
information and we start to believe this

992
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:11,330
information and we start to believe this
 

993
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,570
information and we start to believe this
and therefore it becomes real

994
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:13,580
and therefore it becomes real
 

995
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,720
and therefore it becomes real
innocent in in in as much as anything is

996
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:16,730
innocent in in in as much as anything is
 

997
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:19,779
innocent in in in as much as anything is
real about our cult our perception

998
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:19,789
real about our cult our perception
 

999
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:22,659
real about our cult our perception
together so it's really important

1000
00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:22,669
together so it's really important
 

1001
00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:24,430
together so it's really important
scientifically the ideas that you're

1002
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:24,440
scientifically the ideas that you're
 

1003
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,320
scientifically the ideas that you're
presenting but does that mean there's

1004
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:26,330
presenting but does that mean there's
 

1005
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:28,930
presenting but does that mean there's
just because our brain doesn't feel

1006
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:28,940
just because our brain doesn't feel
 

1007
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,580
just because our brain doesn't feel
those explicit emotions does I mean

1008
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:30,590
those explicit emotions does I mean
 

1009
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,620
those explicit emotions does I mean
they're not real I didn't say we don't

1010
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:32,630
they're not real I didn't say we don't
 

1011
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:35,019
they're not real I didn't say we don't
feel explicit emotions so I want to be

1012
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:35,029
feel explicit emotions so I want to be
 

1013
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:36,970
feel explicit emotions so I want to be
really clear about this because it's an

1014
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:36,980
really clear about this because it's an
 

1015
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,250
really clear about this because it's an
interesting this you know this sum this

1016
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:41,260
interesting this you know this sum this
 

1017
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,360
interesting this you know this sum this
inference it's an interesting inference

1018
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:43,370
inference it's an interesting inference
 

1019
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,810
inference it's an interesting inference
that people often make and so but it's

1020
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:46,820
that people often make and so but it's
 

1021
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,510
that people often make and so but it's
it's a mistake and it's a mistake that

1022
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:49,520
it's a mistake and it's a mistake that
 

1023
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,460
it's a mistake and it's a mistake that
betrays a certain kind of thinking that

1024
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:51,470
betrays a certain kind of thinking that
 

1025
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,240
betrays a certain kind of thinking that
we do in this culture and is it's the

1026
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:55,250
we do in this culture and is it's the
 

1027
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,889
we do in this culture and is it's the
mistake of the following sort so when I

1028
00:22:56,889 --> 00:22:56,899
mistake of the following sort so when I
 

1029
00:22:56,899 --> 00:23:01,090
mistake of the following sort so when I
say there is no facial expression that

1030
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:01,100
say there is no facial expression that
 

1031
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,970
say there is no facial expression that
is diagnostic of a single emotion that

1032
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:03,980
is diagnostic of a single emotion that
 

1033
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,210
is diagnostic of a single emotion that
doesn't mean that people don't express

1034
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:07,220
doesn't mean that people don't express
 

1035
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,549
doesn't mean that people don't express
emotion they certainly do express

1036
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:09,559
emotion they certainly do express
 

1037
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:11,740
emotion they certainly do express
emotion they just don't you know when

1038
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:11,750
emotion they just don't you know when
 

1039
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,750
emotion they just don't you know when
when they're in a state of anger in a

1040
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:13,760
when they're in a state of anger in a
 

1041
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,130
when they're in a state of anger in a
state of sadness or in a state of awe

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:17,929
their faces don't do one thing when I
 

1045
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:20,409
their faces don't do one thing when I
say well your body can do many things

1046
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:20,419
say well your body can do many things
 

1047
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:23,320

when you're angry or when you're sad or
 

1049
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,539
when you're angry or when you're sad or
but let's take anger your heart rate can

1050
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:25,549
but let's take anger your heart rate can
 

1051
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:27,519
but let's take anger your heart rate can
go up it can go down it can stay the

1052
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:27,529
go up it can go down it can stay the
 

1053
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,529
go up it can go down it can stay the
same your breathing rate can go up it

1054
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:29,539
same your breathing rate can go up it
 

1055
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:32,019
same your breathing rate can go up it
can go down it can stay the same the

1056
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:32,029
can go down it can stay the same the
 

1057
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:34,389
can go down it can stay the same the
same pattern that you see in anger you

1058
00:23:34,389 --> 00:23:34,399
same pattern that you see in anger you
 

1059
00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:36,220
same pattern that you see in anger you
sometimes see in sadness and you

1060
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:36,230
sometimes see in sadness and you
 

1061
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,899
sometimes see in sadness and you
sometimes see in fear you sometimes even

sometimes see in fear you sometimes even
 

1063
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:41,529
sometimes see in fear you sometimes even
see it in enthusiasm and in awe so does

1064
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:41,539
see it in enthusiasm and in awe so does
 

1065
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:43,570
see it in enthusiasm and in awe so does
that mean that emotions aren't real no

1066
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:43,580
that mean that emotions aren't real no
 

1067
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,840
that mean that emotions aren't real no
emotions are real but but sometimes

emotions are real but but sometimes
 

1069
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:51,750
emotions are real but but sometimes
things are real because the physical

1070
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:51,760
things are real because the physical
 

1071
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,260
things are real because the physical
meaning of

1072
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:53,270
meaning of
 

1073
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:57,100
meaning of
the signal is endowed in the signal okay

1074
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,110
the signal is endowed in the signal okay
 

1075
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:01,720
the signal is endowed in the signal okay
so when your retina communicates to your

so when your retina communicates to your
 

1077
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:04,600
so when your retina communicates to your
brain that you have that you are faced

the signal it's not like interpret you
 

1087
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,710
the signal it's not like interpret you
don't interpret that it's 600 you know

1088
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:17,720
don't interpret that it's 600 you know
 

1089
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,930
don't interpret that it's 600 you know
nanometers it is 600 nanometers the

1090
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:19,940
nanometers it is 600 nanometers the
 

1091
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,200
nanometers it is 600 nanometers the
informations in the signal but when you

1092
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,210
informations in the signal but when you
 

1093
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:27,400
informations in the signal but when you
see read that information is not in the

1094
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:27,410
see read that information is not in the
 

1095
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:32,440
see read that information is not in the
signal your brain has added information

1096
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:32,450
signal your brain has added information
 

1097
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,810
signal your brain has added information
that isn't in the signal itself in a

that isn't in the signal itself in a
 

1099
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,290
that isn't in the signal itself in a
sense your brain has imposed meaning on

1100
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:38,300
sense your brain has imposed meaning on
 

1101
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,890
sense your brain has imposed meaning on
a signal that the signal doesn't have on

1102
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:41,900
a signal that the signal doesn't have on
 

1103
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,470
a signal that the signal doesn't have on
its own they'll let me back up and give

1104
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:44,480
its own they'll let me back up and give
 

1105
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,030
its own they'll let me back up and give
a different example to make it a little

1106
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:46,040
a different example to make it a little
 

1107
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,570
a different example to make it a little
easier and then will reproach this

1108
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:48,580
easier and then will reproach this
 

1109
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:52,170
easier and then will reproach this
there's a there are some things that we

1110
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:52,180
there's a there are some things that we
 

1111
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:55,590
there's a there are some things that we
impose this is true almost of all

1112
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:55,600
impose this is true almost of all
 

1113
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,180
impose this is true almost of all
civilization right that we there are

00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:58,190
civilization right that we there are
 

1115
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,680
civilization right that we there are

00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,940
certain reward it's important to kind of
have some ground truth and and learn so

1274
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:52,950
have some ground truth and and learn so
 

1275
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:55,670
have some ground truth and and learn so
how do it sounds like the expression of

1276
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:55,680
how do it sounds like the expression of
 

1277
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,310
how do it sounds like the expression of
emotion is learned can you talk about

1278
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:58,320
emotion is learned can you talk about
 

1279
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,910
emotion is learned can you talk about
how we learn to fit into our culture by

1280
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:01,920
how we learn to fit into our culture by
 

1281
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,730
how we learn to fit into our culture by
expressing emotion with our phase body

1282
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:04,740
expressing emotion with our phase body
 

1283
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,820
expressing emotion with our phase body
given the context given the rich what's

1284
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:07,830
given the context given the rich what's
 

1285
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,200
given the context given the rich what's
that process look like when does it

1286
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,210
that process look like when does it
 

1287
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,600
that process look like when does it
happen

1288
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:10,610
happen
 

1289
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:14,390
happen
how much sure well you know I mean yeah

1290
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:14,400
how much sure well you know I mean yeah
 

1291
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,490
how much sure well you know I mean yeah
I wrote a 400 page book so I'll try to

1292
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:16,500
I wrote a 400 page book so I'll try to
 

1293
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:24,910
I wrote a 400 page book so I'll try to
do it in like a couple sentences yeah so

1294
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:24,920
do it in like a couple sentences yeah so
 

1295
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,320
do it in like a couple sentences yeah so
so how does it how does an infant learn

1296
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:27,330
so how does it how does an infant learn
 

1297
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:32,600
so how does it how does an infant learn
anything so an infant's born and it

1298
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:32,610
anything so an infant's born and it
 

1299
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,020
anything so an infant's born and it
can't

1300
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,030
can't
 

1301
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:35,870
can't
do anything for itself it can't regulate

1302
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:35,880
do anything for itself it can't regulate
 

1303
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,450
do anything for itself it can't regulate
its own nervous system it can't keep its

1304
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:38,460
its own nervous system it can't keep its
 

1305
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,330
its own nervous system it can't keep its
body systems balanced this is a term

1306
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:41,340
body systems balanced this is a term
 

1307
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,670
body systems balanced this is a term
scientific term for this is alice stasis

1308
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:43,680
scientific term for this is alice stasis
 

1309
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,890
scientific term for this is alice stasis
alice stasis is your brain's ability to

1310
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:45,900
alice stasis is your brain's ability to
 

1311
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,660
alice stasis is your brain's ability to
predict what your body is going to need

1312
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:47,670
predict what your body is going to need
 

1313
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,880
predict what your body is going to need
before it needs it and tries to meet

1314
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:49,890
before it needs it and tries to meet
 

1315
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:53,180
before it needs it and tries to meet
those needs before they arise so an

1316
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:53,190
those needs before they arise so an
 

1317
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,980
those needs before they arise so an
example would be if you're gonna stand

1318
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:54,990
example would be if you're gonna stand
 

1319
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,780
example would be if you're gonna stand
up if your brain is gonna stand you up

1320
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:56,790
up if your brain is gonna stand you up
 

1321
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,130
up if your brain is gonna stand you up
it has to raise your blood pressure

1322
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:58,140
it has to raise your blood pressure
 

1323
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,920
it has to raise your blood pressure
before it stands you up if it doesn't

1324
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:00,930
before it stands you up if it doesn't
 

1325
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:04,280
before it stands you up if it doesn't
you'll fall that's costly from metabolic

1326
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:04,290
you'll fall that's costly from metabolic
 

1327
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,500
you'll fall that's costly from metabolic
standpoint it's costly you'll hurt

1328
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:06,510
standpoint it's costly you'll hurt
 

1329
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:11,210
standpoint it's costly you'll hurt
yourself so an infant's brain can't do

1330
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:11,220
yourself so an infant's brain can't do
 

1331
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,420
yourself so an infant's brain can't do
this very well an infant doesn't know

1332
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:14,430
this very well an infant doesn't know
 

1333
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,070
this very well an infant doesn't know
when to go to sleep and when to wake up

1334
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:16,080
when to go to sleep and when to wake up
 

1335
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,730
when to go to sleep and when to wake up
an infant doesn't can't feed itself

1336
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:19,740
an infant doesn't can't feed itself
 

1337
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,430
an infant doesn't can't feed itself
can't regulate its own temperature

1338
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:21,440
can't regulate its own temperature
 

1339
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,740
can't regulate its own temperature
someone else has to do it and when

1340
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:24,750
someone else has to do it and when
 

1341
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,940
someone else has to do it and when
someone does it the infant is learning

1342
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:27,950
someone does it the infant is learning
 

1343
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:32,990
someone does it the infant is learning
the infant is learning it's taking in

1344
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:33,000
the infant is learning it's taking in
 

1345
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,710
the infant is learning it's taking in
sights and sounds and smells and the

1346
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:36,720
sights and sounds and smells and the
 

1347
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,560
sights and sounds and smells and the
physical sensations from the body which

1348
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:39,570
physical sensations from the body which
 

1349
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:43,370
physical sensations from the body which
are comfortable and pleasant when the

1350
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:43,380
are comfortable and pleasant when the
 

1351
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:47,600
are comfortable and pleasant when the
infant Alice stasis is maintained so

1352
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:47,610
infant Alice stasis is maintained so
 

1353
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:51,320
infant Alice stasis is maintained so
right from the get-go an infant is

1354
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:51,330
right from the get-go an infant is
 

1355
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:56,090
right from the get-go an infant is
learning statistical learning you know

1356
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:56,100
learning statistical learning you know
 

1357
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,990
learning statistical learning you know
the capturing events including their

1358
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:00,000
the capturing events including their
 

1359
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,820
the capturing events including their
consequence for the infant's body

consequence for the infant's body
some people think babies are born you

1362
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:03,780
some people think babies are born you
 

1363
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,420
some people think babies are born you
know attached already to their

1364
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:05,430
know attached already to their
 

1365
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,870
know attached already to their
caregivers but they're not actually

1366
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:07,880
caregivers but they're not actually
 

1367
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,130
caregivers but they're not actually
infants don't even know what a caregiver

1368
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:10,140
infants don't even know what a caregiver
 

1369
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,470
infants don't even know what a caregiver
is it's just that the caregiver is there

1370
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:12,480
is it's just that the caregiver is there
 

1371
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,780
is it's just that the caregiver is there
constantly meeting that infant's needs

1372
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:14,790
constantly meeting that infant's needs
 

1373
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,570
constantly meeting that infant's needs
that's how infants start to learn now if

1374
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:17,580
that's how infants start to learn now if
 

1375
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,970
that's how infants start to learn now if
there are statistical regularities like

1376
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:19,980
there are statistical regularities like
 

1377
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,070
there are statistical regularities like
for example an infant is not born with

1378
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,080
for example an infant is not born with
 

1379
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,050
for example an infant is not born with
the ability to recognize a face as a

1380
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:24,060
the ability to recognize a face as a
 

1381
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,420
the ability to recognize a face as a
face but it learns that in like the

1382
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:26,430
face but it learns that in like the
 

1383
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,910
face but it learns that in like the
first couple of days of life why because

1384
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:28,920
first couple of days of life why because
 

1385
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,160
first couple of days of life why because
human faces have some statistical

1386
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,170
human faces have some statistical
 

1387
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:33,890
human faces have some statistical
regularities to them right to eyes and

1388
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:33,900
regularities to them right to eyes and
 

1389
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,630
regularities to them right to eyes and
nose and a mouth kind of in the same

1390
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:35,640
nose and a mouth kind of in the same
 

1391
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,780
nose and a mouth kind of in the same
place most of the time so it learns

1392
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:38,790
place most of the time so it learns
 

1393
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:41,570
place most of the time so it learns
really quickly but here's the

1394
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:41,580
really quickly but here's the
 

1395
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,730
really quickly but here's the
interesting thing around three months of

1396
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:43,740
interesting thing around three months of
 

1397
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,850
interesting thing around three months of
age infants start to learn

1398
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:46,860
age infants start to learn
 

1399
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:51,110
age infants start to learn
what we call abstract categories they

1400
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:51,120
what we call abstract categories they
 

1401
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,870
what we call abstract categories they
start to learn that some things which

1402
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:53,880
start to learn that some things which
 

1403
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,900
start to learn that some things which
don't look the same or sound the same or

1404
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:56,910
don't look the same or sound the same or
 

1405
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:01,220
don't look the same or sound the same or
smell the same actually have the same

1406
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:01,230
smell the same actually have the same
 

1407
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:04,580
smell the same actually have the same
function and how do they learn this they

1408
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:04,590
function and how do they learn this they
 

1409
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,490
function and how do they learn this they
learn it with words so if you do an

1410
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:07,500
learn it with words so if you do an
 

1411
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,100
learn it with words so if you do an
experiment with a three month old three

1412
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:10,110
experiment with a three month old three
 

1413
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:12,680
experiment with a three month old three
months old okay and you say to that baby

1414
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:12,690
months old okay and you say to that baby
 

1415
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:15,850
months old okay and you say to that baby
very very intentionally look sweetie

1416
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:15,860
very very intentionally look sweetie
 

1417
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:21,230
very very intentionally look sweetie
this is a one and you put the web down

1418
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:21,240
this is a one and you put the web down
 

1419
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,850
this is a one and you put the web down
and it makes a noise like a beep and

1420
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:25,860
and it makes a noise like a beep and
 

1421
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,240
and it makes a noise like a beep and
then you say I'm like I don't have props

1422
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:29,250
then you say I'm like I don't have props
 

1423
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:32,840
then you say I'm like I don't have props
and then you see my wallet yeah okay and

1424
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:32,850
and then you see my wallet yeah okay and
 

1425
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,190
and then you see my wallet yeah okay and
then you say give me your wallet yeah

1426
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:34,200
then you say give me your wallet yeah
 

1427
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,289
then you say give me your wallet yeah
give me your wallet and then you say

1428
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:38,299
give me your wallet and then you say
 

1429
00:32:38,299 --> 00:32:39,830
give me your wallet and then you say
look sweetie

1430
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:39,840
look sweetie
 

1431
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,130
look sweetie
this is a WoG and you put the wog down

1432
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:43,140
this is a WoG and you put the wog down
 

1433
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,990
this is a WoG and you put the wog down
and it makes a beep if you say look

1434
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,000
and it makes a beep if you say look
 

1435
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,680
and it makes a beep if you say look
sweetie

1436
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:48,690
sweetie
 

1437
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:55,010
sweetie
this is a WoG that infant expects that

1438
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:55,020
this is a WoG that infant expects that
 

1439
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,250
this is a WoG that infant expects that
object to beep why is that important

1440
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:58,260
object to beep why is that important
 

1441
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,490
object to beep why is that important
because in the real experiments this

1442
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:01,500
because in the real experiments this
 

1443
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:06,440
because in the real experiments this
might be yellow and squishy and tall and

might be yellow and squishy and tall and
 

1445
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:11,240
might be yellow and squishy and tall and
this might be red and pointy and you

1446
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:11,250
this might be red and pointy and you
 

1447
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,850
this might be red and pointy and you
know hard and this might be you know so

1448
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:13,860
know hard and this might be you know so
 

1449
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,570

lots of different perceptual features
 

1451
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:24,500

like what they look like and you can
 

1469
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,190

name three of them with one word and

1470
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:49,200
name three of them with one word and

you and I both learn that that package
of sensory array means something so when

1536

of sensory array means something so when

to do to keep itself alive right and
well but it has to it has to know what

1584
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:25,900
well but it has to it has to know what
 

1585
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,660
well but it has to it has to know what
to do based on it has to know what

1586
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:27,670
to do based on it has to know what
 

1587
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:30,269
to do based on it has to know what
what's happening all around it only from

1588
00:36:30,269 --> 00:36:30,279
what's happening all around it only from
 

1589
00:36:30,279 --> 00:36:33,120
what's happening all around it only from
the effects that it receives through the

1590
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,130
the effects that it receives through the
 

1591
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:36,900
the effects that it receives through the
sensory systems of the body so a flash

1592
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:36,910
sensory systems of the body so a flash
 

1593
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:37,799
sensory systems of the body so a flash
of light

1594
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:37,809
of light
 

1595
00:36:37,809 --> 00:36:39,269
of light
what's a flash of light it could be

1596
00:36:39,269 --> 00:36:39,279
what's a flash of light it could be
 

1597
00:36:39,279 --> 00:36:42,809
what's a flash of light it could be
anything what you know what's a look

1598
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:42,819
anything what you know what's a look
 

1599
00:36:42,819 --> 00:36:45,480
anything what you know what's a look
like a siren a siren could be you know a

1600
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:45,490
like a siren a siren could be you know a
 

1601
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:49,319
like a siren a siren could be you know a
firetruck or it could be somebody's car

1602
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:49,329
firetruck or it could be somebody's car
 

1603
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:51,599
firetruck or it could be somebody's car
alarm went off or it could be a doorbell

1604
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:51,609
alarm went off or it could be a doorbell
 

1605
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:53,599
alarm went off or it could be a doorbell
or it could be right any particular

1606
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:53,609
or it could be right any particular
 

1607
00:36:53,609 --> 00:36:56,549
or it could be right any particular
sensory cue could have multiple causes

1608
00:36:56,549 --> 00:36:56,559
sensory cue could have multiple causes
 

1609
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:59,309
sensory cue could have multiple causes
so your brains trapped basically in your

1610
00:36:59,309 --> 00:36:59,319
so your brains trapped basically in your
 

1611
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:02,120
so your brains trapped basically in your
skull and all it gets are the effects

1612
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:02,130
skull and all it gets are the effects
 

1613
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:05,309
skull and all it gets are the effects
the sensory effects of stuff that

1614
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:05,319
the sensory effects of stuff that
 

1615
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:07,049
the sensory effects of stuff that
happens in the world but it has to

1616
00:37:07,049 --> 00:37:07,059
happens in the world but it has to
 

1617
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:09,569
happens in the world but it has to
figure out what those things are so that

1618
00:37:09,569 --> 00:37:09,579
figure out what those things are so that
 

1619
00:37:09,579 --> 00:37:11,339
figure out what those things are so that
it knows what to do so how does it do

1620
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:11,349
it knows what to do so how does it do
 

1621
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:13,200
it knows what to do so how does it do
that well it has something else that it

1622
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:13,210
that well it has something else that it
 

1623
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,509
that well it has something else that it
can draw on it has your past experiences

1624
00:37:15,509 --> 00:37:15,519
can draw on it has your past experiences
 

1625
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:20,059
can draw on it has your past experiences
your brain basically is doesn't store

1626
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:20,069
your brain basically is doesn't store
 

1627
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:22,470
your brain basically is doesn't store
experiences from the past it can

1628
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:22,480
experiences from the past it can
 

1629
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,079
experiences from the past it can
reconstitute them in its wiring and

1630
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:27,089
reconstitute them in its wiring and
 

1631
00:37:27,089 --> 00:37:30,900
reconstitute them in its wiring and
that's what it uses to guess at what

1632
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:30,910
that's what it uses to guess at what
 

1633
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:33,809
that's what it uses to guess at what
those sensory cues me of those sensory

1634
00:37:33,809 --> 00:37:33,819
those sensory cues me of those sensory
 

1635
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:38,880
those sensory cues me of those sensory
changes me so in one situation a siren

1636
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:38,890
changes me so in one situation a siren
 

1637
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,799
changes me so in one situation a siren
means one thing in another situation it

1638
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:40,809
means one thing in another situation it
 

1639
00:37:40,809 --> 00:37:42,539
means one thing in another situation it
means another a flash of light means one

1640
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:42,549
means another a flash of light means one
 

1641
00:37:42,549 --> 00:37:44,460
means another a flash of light means one
thing in one situation and a different

1642
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:44,470
thing in one situation and a different
 

1643
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,470
thing in one situation and a different
thing in another so your brain is using

1644
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:46,480
thing in another so your brain is using
 

1645
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,210
thing in another so your brain is using
past experience to make guesses about

1646
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:48,220
past experience to make guesses about
 

1647
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:51,089
past experience to make guesses about
what these sensory changes me and so

1648
00:37:51,089 --> 00:37:51,099
what these sensory changes me and so
 

1649
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:54,720
what these sensory changes me and so
that it knows what to do and it has the

1650
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:54,730
that it knows what to do and it has the
 

1651
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,700
that it knows what to do and it has the
same relationship to the sensory changes

1652
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:56,710
same relationship to the sensory changes
 

1653
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,749
same relationship to the sensory changes
in your body

1654
00:37:57,749 --> 00:37:57,759
in your body
 

1655
00:37:57,759 --> 00:38:01,499
in your body
what's an ache in your stomach well it

1656
00:38:01,499 --> 00:38:01,509
what's an ache in your stomach well it
 

1657
00:38:01,509 --> 00:38:05,249
what's an ache in your stomach well it
could be hunger it could be anger it

1658
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:05,259
could be hunger it could be anger it
 

1659
00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:06,960
could be hunger it could be anger it
could be discussed it could be longing

1660
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:06,970
could be discussed it could be longing
 

1661
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:11,519
could be discussed it could be longing
it could be nausea it's not that there's

1662
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:11,529
it could be nausea it's not that there's
 

1663
00:38:11,529 --> 00:38:15,150
it could be nausea it's not that there's
one ache in your stomach for nausea and

1664
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:15,160
one ache in your stomach for nausea and
 

1665
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,769
one ache in your stomach for nausea and
another ache in your stomach for hunger

1666
00:38:18,769 --> 00:38:18,779
another ache in your stomach for hunger
 

1667
00:38:18,779 --> 00:38:20,520
another ache in your stomach for hunger
there are many

1668
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:20,530
there are many
 

1669
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,320
there are many
aches in your stomach any different

1670
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:22,330
aches in your stomach any different
 

1671
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:24,960
aches in your stomach any different
feelings of achiness for nausea and many

1672
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:24,970
feelings of achiness for nausea and many
 

1673
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,460
feelings of achiness for nausea and many
different feelings of aching is for

1674
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:26,470
different feelings of aching is for
 

1675
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,250
different feelings of aching is for
hunger and sometimes they overlap so

1676
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:29,260
hunger and sometimes they overlap so
 

1677
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,930
hunger and sometimes they overlap so
your brain has to make the same kinds of

1678
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:30,940
your brain has to make the same kinds of
 

1679
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,160
your brain has to make the same kinds of
guesses about what's going on in your

1680
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,170
guesses about what's going on in your
 

1681
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:34,200
guesses about what's going on in your
body as it does about what the sensory

1682
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:34,210
body as it does about what the sensory
 

1683
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,210
body as it does about what the sensory
events mean in the world and that's

1684
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:36,220
events mean in the world and that's
 

1685
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,710
events mean in the world and that's
really what it's doing it's it's

1686
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:37,720
really what it's doing it's it's
 

1687
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,050
really what it's doing it's it's
guessing and making sense of the sensory

1688
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:40,060
guessing and making sense of the sensory
 

1689
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,390
guessing and making sense of the sensory
array so that it knows what to do next

1690
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:42,400
array so that it knows what to do next
 

1691
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,120
array so that it knows what to do next
and when it guesses wrong it takes in

1692
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,130
and when it guesses wrong it takes in
 

1693
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:48,200
and when it guesses wrong it takes in
that the you know the the sort of

1694
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,210
that the you know the the sort of
 

1695
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:51,080
that the you know the the sort of
information that it didn't predict well

1696
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,090
information that it didn't predict well
 

1697
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,970
information that it didn't predict well
which you know in psychology we have a

1698
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:53,980
which you know in psychology we have a
 

1699
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,550
which you know in psychology we have a
really fancy name for that we call it

1700
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:56,560
really fancy name for that we call it
 

1701
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,430
really fancy name for that we call it
learning your brain takes in the

1702
00:38:59,430 --> 00:38:59,440
learning your brain takes in the
 

1703
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,190
learning your brain takes in the
information that it didn't predict and

1704
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:02,200
information that it didn't predict and
 

1705
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,390
information that it didn't predict and
so that it can predict better than the

1706
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:03,400
so that it can predict better than the
 

1707
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,640
so that it can predict better than the
next time to make sense of things the

1708
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:05,650
next time to make sense of things the
 

1709
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:10,770
next time to make sense of things the
next time so you kind of answered this a

1710
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:10,780
next time so you kind of answered this a
 

1711
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,080
next time so you kind of answered this a
little bit I'd like to elaborate on it

1712
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:13,090
little bit I'd like to elaborate on it
 

1713
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:15,390
little bit I'd like to elaborate on it
if you were to build a robot that

1714
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:15,400
if you were to build a robot that
 

1715
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,120
if you were to build a robot that
performs maybe passes the Turing test or

1716
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:18,130
performs maybe passes the Turing test or
 

1717
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,960
performs maybe passes the Turing test or
performs at the low bar level of instead

1718
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:21,970
performs at the low bar level of instead
 

1719
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:24,030
performs at the low bar level of instead
of myself here today it would be a robot

1720
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:24,040
of myself here today it would be a robot
 

1721
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,010
of myself here today it would be a robot
talking to you it'd be convincing as a

1722
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:26,020
talking to you it'd be convincing as a
 

1723
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:30,900
talking to you it'd be convincing as a
human how would you what kind of how

1724
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:30,910
human how would you what kind of how
 

1725
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,480
human how would you what kind of how
would you build that system in a sense

1726
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:32,490
would you build that system in a sense
 

1727
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:35,820
would you build that system in a sense
in paralleling the infant's what

1728
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:35,830
in paralleling the infant's what
 

1729
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:38,040
in paralleling the infant's what
essential aspect of the infant

1730
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,050
essential aspect of the infant
 

1731
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:41,700
essential aspect of the infant
experience do you think is important it

1732
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:41,710
experience do you think is important it
 

1733
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:44,040
experience do you think is important it
needs to well I mean I you know I don't

1734
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,050
needs to well I mean I you know I don't
 

1735
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:48,300
needs to well I mean I you know I don't
I'm not a computer scientist so but so

1736
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:48,310
I'm not a computer scientist so but so
 

1737
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,770
I'm not a computer scientist so but so
the way that I would say it is it needs

1738
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:49,780
the way that I would say it is it needs
 

1739
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,640
the way that I would say it is it needs
to have a body

1740
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:50,650
to have a body
 

1741
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:53,130
to have a body
these have something like physical

1742
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:53,140
these have something like physical
 

1743
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,990
these have something like physical
systems or an analogy to physical

1744
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:55,000
systems or an analogy to physical
 

1745
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,240
systems or an analogy to physical
systems it has to do something analogous

1746
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:57,250
systems it has to do something analogous
 

1747
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:00,300
systems it has to do something analogous
to a low stasis so whatwhat's sorry to

1748
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:00,310
to a low stasis so whatwhat's sorry to
 

1749
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:03,300
to a low stasis so whatwhat's sorry to
elaborate so what would be the goal for

1750
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:03,310
elaborate so what would be the goal for
 

1751
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,680
elaborate so what would be the goal for
the system you kind of mentioned

1752
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:04,690
the system you kind of mentioned
 

1753
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:07,020
the system you kind of mentioned
previously that the goal will be to for

1754
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:07,030
previously that the goal will be to for
 

1755
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,780
previously that the goal will be to for
the brain to just stabilize itself no

1756
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:09,790
the brain to just stabilize itself no
 

1757
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,010
the brain to just stabilize itself no
it's not that the brain is stabilized

1758
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:11,020
it's not that the brain is stabilized
 

1759
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,360
it's not that the brain is stabilized
though you know so people talk about

1760
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:12,370
though you know so people talk about
 

1761
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:16,230
though you know so people talk about
reward what is reward and machine

1762
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:16,240
reward what is reward and machine
 

1763
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,180
reward what is reward and machine
learning is pretty easy it's it's

1764
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:18,190
learning is pretty easy it's it's
 

1765
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,170
learning is pretty easy it's it's
something but

1766
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:20,180
something but
 

1767
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,870
something but
it's it's mathematical so it's there's

1768
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:23,880
it's it's mathematical so it's there's
 

1769
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,940
it's it's mathematical so it's there's
no philosophy to it you just

1770
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:25,950
no philosophy to it you just
 

1771
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,680
no philosophy to it you just
oh yeah there's philosophy to everything

1772
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:27,690
oh yeah there's philosophy to everything
 

1773
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,660
oh yeah there's philosophy to everything
right whether you admit it or not as a

1774
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:29,670
right whether you admit it or not as a
 

1775
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,989
right whether you admit it or not as a
different story right yeah so you wanted

1776
00:40:32,989 --> 00:40:32,999
different story right yeah so you wanted
 

1777
00:40:32,999 --> 00:40:35,269
different story right yeah so you wanted
to play a game of chess playing give

1778
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:35,279
to play a game of chess playing give
 

1779
00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:37,430
to play a game of chess playing give
them go you wanted to pick up a water

1780
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:37,440
them go you wanted to pick up a water
 

1781
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,430
them go you wanted to pick up a water
bottle is uh okay but what is reward

1782
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:42,440

 

1783
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:48,259

existence dopamine is actually not

1784
00:40:48,259 --> 00:40:48,269
existence dopamine is actually not
 

1785
00:40:48,269 --> 00:40:50,960
existence dopamine is actually not
reward dopamine is effort dopamine is

1786
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:50,970
reward dopamine is effort dopamine is
 

1787
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:52,759
reward dopamine is effort dopamine is
necessary for effort it's not necessary

1788
00:40:52,759 --> 00:40:52,769
necessary for effort it's not necessary
 

1789
00:40:52,769 --> 00:40:53,479
necessary for effort it's not necessary
for reward

1790
00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:53,489
for reward
 

1791
00:40:53,489 --> 00:40:57,200
for reward
maybe it's commonly if you read the most

1792
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:57,210
maybe it's commonly if you read the most
 

1793
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,089
maybe it's commonly if you read the most
caught those up to date literature that

1794
00:40:59,089 --> 00:40:59,099
caught those up to date literature that
 

1795
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:01,130
caught those up to date literature that
is what you'll see that it's actually

1796
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:01,140
is what you'll see that it's actually
 

1797
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,579
is what you'll see that it's actually
people can animals can find things

1798
00:41:04,579 --> 00:41:04,589
people can animals can find things
 

1799
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:08,599
people can animals can find things
rewarding can be without without

1800
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:08,609
rewarding can be without without
 

1801
00:41:08,609 --> 00:41:11,390
rewarding can be without without
dopamine actually but they they they

1802
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:11,400
dopamine actually but they they they
 

1803
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,819
dopamine actually but they they they
need to open to move they need dopamine

1804
00:41:13,819 --> 00:41:13,829
need to open to move they need dopamine
 

1805
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:16,099
need to open to move they need dopamine
to encode fits and to learn information

1806
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:16,109
to encode fits and to learn information
 

1807
00:41:16,109 --> 00:41:18,140
to encode fits and to learn information
so it's really for effort that is

1808
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:18,150
so it's really for effort that is
 

1809
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:20,870
so it's really for effort that is
required to work towards getting a

1810
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:20,880
required to work towards getting a
 

1811
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,089
required to work towards getting a
reward I would say and when the when a

1812
00:41:26,089 --> 00:41:26,099
reward I would say and when the when a
 

1813
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:28,789
reward I would say and when the when a
brain an animal brain a human any kind

1814
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:28,799
brain an animal brain a human any kind
 

1815
00:41:28,799 --> 00:41:31,190
brain an animal brain a human any kind
of animal brain miss predicts what the

1816
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:31,200
of animal brain miss predicts what the
 

1817
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,259
of animal brain miss predicts what the
reward will be that's what you see a

1818
00:41:33,259 --> 00:41:33,269
reward will be that's what you see a
 

1819
00:41:33,269 --> 00:41:36,259
reward will be that's what you see a
real surge of dopamine because it the

1820
00:41:36,259 --> 00:41:36,269
real surge of dopamine because it the
 

1821
00:41:36,269 --> 00:41:40,069
real surge of dopamine because it the
animal has to adjust its action but

1822
00:41:40,069 --> 00:41:40,079
animal has to adjust its action but
 

1823
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,029
animal has to adjust its action but
reward is basically bringing the body

1824
00:41:44,029 --> 00:41:44,039
reward is basically bringing the body
 

1825
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:46,609
reward is basically bringing the body
back into a low stasis it feels good

1826
00:41:46,609 --> 00:41:46,619
back into a low stasis it feels good
 

1827
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:49,460
back into a low stasis it feels good
when that happens and people will and

1828
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:49,470
when that happens and people will and
 

1829
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:53,569
when that happens and people will and
animals will work tremendously hard to

1830
00:41:53,569 --> 00:41:53,579
animals will work tremendously hard to
 

1831
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:57,890
animals will work tremendously hard to
have that happen so you know what is

1832
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:57,900
have that happen so you know what is
 

1833
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:01,460
have that happen so you know what is
motivation motivation is is expending

1834
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:01,470
motivation motivation is is expending
 

1835
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:07,009
motivation motivation is is expending
resources to get a reward so basically

1836
00:42:07,009 --> 00:42:07,019
resources to get a reward so basically
 

1837
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:13,910
resources to get a reward so basically
if if you don't have something

1838
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:13,920
if if you don't have something
 

1839
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,819
if if you don't have something
like physical systems that have to be

1840
00:42:16,819 --> 00:42:16,829
like physical systems that have to be
 

1841
00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:20,480
like physical systems that have to be
kept in balance water I mean for humans

1842
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:20,490
kept in balance water I mean for humans
 

1843
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:25,280
kept in balance water I mean for humans
or for actually any living creature on

1844
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,290
or for actually any living creature on
 

1845
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:28,940
or for actually any living creature on
this planet even you know single-cell

1846
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:28,950
this planet even you know single-cell
 

1847
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,710
this planet even you know single-cell
organisms actually there's an analogy to

1848
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:30,720
organisms actually there's an analogy to
 

1849
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,410
organisms actually there's an analogy to
what we're talking about here to brains

1850
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:33,420
what we're talking about here to brains
 

1851
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:38,299
what we're talking about here to brains
but you know salt water glucose all

1852
00:42:38,299 --> 00:42:38,309
but you know salt water glucose all
 

1853
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:40,160
but you know salt water glucose all
these systems have to be kept in balance

1854
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:40,170
these systems have to be kept in balance
 

1855
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:41,690
these systems have to be kept in balance
and they have to be kept in balance in a

1856
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:41,700
and they have to be kept in balance in a
 

1857
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:46,760
and they have to be kept in balance in a
very very efficient way and that's the

1858
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:46,770
very very efficient way and that's the
 

1859
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:49,250
very very efficient way and that's the
motivating so-called motivating force

1860
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:49,260
motivating so-called motivating force
 

1861
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:52,220
motivating so-called motivating force
really that's what that's what that's

1862
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:52,230
really that's what that's what that's
 

1863
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:55,309
really that's what that's what that's
what really brains are for so yeah and

1864
00:42:55,309 --> 00:42:55,319
what really brains are for so yeah and
 

1865
00:42:55,319 --> 00:42:58,609
what really brains are for so yeah and
that is the basis the consequence of

1866
00:42:58,609 --> 00:42:58,619
that is the basis the consequence of
 

1867
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:01,640
that is the basis the consequence of
that regulation it are the basis of you

1868
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:01,650
that regulation it are the basis of you
 

1869
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:04,539
that regulation it are the basis of you
know effective feelings which are for

1870
00:43:04,539 --> 00:43:04,549
know effective feelings which are for
 

1871
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:07,880

many many creatures on this planet a
 

1873
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:13,339
many many creatures on this planet a
property of consciousness ok so maybe if

1874
00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:13,349
property of consciousness ok so maybe if
 

1875
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:15,049
property of consciousness ok so maybe if
it's ok we'll take some questions in the

1876
00:43:15,049 --> 00:43:15,059
it's ok we'll take some questions in the
 

1877
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,120
it's ok we'll take some questions in the
audience but first let me ask the last

1878
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,130
audience but first let me ask the last
 

1879
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,849
audience but first let me ask the last
question as so I'm building on the robot

1880
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:19,859
question as so I'm building on the robot
 

1881
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:23,599
question as so I'm building on the robot
question how would you build the same

1882
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:23,609
question how would you build the same
 

1883
00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:26,450
question how would you build the same
kind of robot that you would be able to

1884
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:26,460
kind of robot that you would be able to
 

1885
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:31,670
kind of robot that you would be able to
as a human being fall in love with well

1886
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:31,680
as a human being fall in love with well
 

1887
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,230
as a human being fall in love with well
you know people fall in love with their

1888
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:33,240
you know people fall in love with their
 

1889
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:38,329
you know people fall in love with their
cars they fall in love with they fall in

1890
00:43:38,329 --> 00:43:38,339
cars they fall in love with they fall in
 

1891
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:40,220
cars they fall in love with they fall in
love with their blankets they fall in

1892
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:40,230

1935
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,420
animal it means that we regulate each
other's nervous systems so our brain my

1936
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:32,430
other's nervous systems so our brain my
 

1937
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:34,700
other's nervous systems so our brain my
brain isn't just regulating my nervous

brain isn't just regulating my nervous
 

1939
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:37,309
brain isn't just regulating my nervous
system right now it's regulating yours

1940
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:37,319
system right now it's regulating yours
 

1941
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:40,130
system right now it's regulating yours
and actually it's regulating other other

1942
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:40,140
and actually it's regulating other other
 

1943
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,749

versa and why is that you know I mean
 

1947
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:46,519
versa and why is that you know I mean
other animals do it too

insects that are social species they
regulate each other's nervous systems

1956

regulate each other's nervous systems
 

1957
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:55,670
regulate each other's nervous systems
they do it with chemicals they do it

1958

mammals like rats well they also use

1976
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:16,650
mammals like rats well they also use
 

1977

and as primates we do all weaves all of
 

1985
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,839
and as primates we do all weaves all of
those senses to regulate each other and

those senses to regulate each other and
 

1987
00:45:32,849 --> 00:45:37,370
those senses to regulate each other and
we also use something else words right

1988
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:37,380
we also use something else words right
 

1989
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,400
we also use something else words right
exactly and words the systems in our

00:46:47,489 --> 00:46:50,779
breathe faster it can make you breathe
slower and the words also have an effect

2048
00:46:50,779 --> 00:46:50,789
slower and the words also have an effect
 

2049
00:46:50,789 --> 00:46:55,549
slower and the words also have an effect
because when I say a word like hmm I

2050
00:46:55,549 --> 00:46:55,559
because when I say a word like hmm I
 

2051
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:58,299
because when I say a word like hmm I
don't know

2052
00:46:58,299 --> 00:46:58,309
don't know
 

2053
00:46:58,309 --> 00:47:02,420
don't know
when I say word like car that's a short

2054
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:02,430
when I say word like car that's a short
 

2055
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:06,229
when I say word like car that's a short
form I have a bunch of mental features

2056
00:47:06,229 --> 00:47:06,239
form I have a bunch of mental features
 

2057
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,630
form I have a bunch of mental features
in my mind when I say the word car and I

2058
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:08,640
in my mind when I say the word car and I
 

2059
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,969
in my mind when I say the word car and I
say that word and that invokes those

2060
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:10,979
say that word and that invokes those
 

2061
00:47:10,979 --> 00:47:12,739
say that word and that invokes those
similar mental features maybe not

2062
00:47:12,739 --> 00:47:12,749
similar mental features maybe not
 

2063
00:47:12,749 --> 00:47:14,660
similar mental features maybe not
identical but similar enough that

2064
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:14,670
identical but similar enough that
 

2065
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:20,660
identical but similar enough that
invokes it in your mind and your mind is

2066
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:20,670
invokes it in your mind and your mind is
 

2067
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:24,289
invokes it in your mind and your mind is
made by your brain so it invokes if I

2068
00:47:24,289 --> 00:47:24,299
made by your brain so it invokes if I
 

2069
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:27,829
made by your brain so it invokes if I
just say the word car there are changes

2070
00:47:27,829 --> 00:47:27,839
just say the word car there are changes
 

2071
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,650
just say the word car there are changes
in your motor system that would be

2072
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:30,660
in your motor system that would be
 

2073
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:34,160
in your motor system that would be
exactly the same or very close as if you

2074
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:34,170
exactly the same or very close as if you
 

2075
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:38,930
exactly the same or very close as if you
were actually in a car right so this is

2076
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:38,940
were actually in a car right so this is
 

2077
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:44,180
were actually in a car right so this is
something that we do and the fact we're

00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:54,049
close friends comes from the ability
 

2085
00:47:54,049 --> 00:47:56,539
close friends comes from the ability
that we have to regulate each other's

2086
00:47:56,539 --> 00:47:56,549
that we have to regulate each other's
 

2087
00:47:56,549 --> 00:47:59,910
that we have to regulate each other's

2089
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:05,040

and that is why when you don't have that

and that is why when you don't have that
 

2091
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:09,380
and that is why when you don't have that

with you know birthing the infant but it
also has to do with the metabolic cost

00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:56,950
also has to do with the metabolic cost

what did evolution do to solve this
problem well it couldn't make our brains

2138
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:14,350
problem well it couldn't make our brains
 

2139
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:16,890
problem well it couldn't make our brains
any bigger so it just entrained other

any bigger so it just entrained other
 

2141
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,810
any bigger so it just entrained other

2145
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:25,410

00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,580
the burden of yours not always at the

00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:29,590
same time but that's what it means to
 

2151
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:32,250
same time but that's what it means to
give people support when someone when

00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:32,260
give people support when someone when
 

2153

to you or gives you a hug they are
 

2159
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:39,450
to you or gives you a hug they are
physically having an effect on your body

on its own and so the basis of love or
 

2169
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,220
on its own and so the basis of love or
attachment is basically that it's the

attachment is basically that it's the
 

2171
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:55,770
attachment is basically that it's the
ability to affect each other's nervous

ability to affect each other's nervous
 

2173
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:58,350
ability to affect each other's nervous
systems in a positive way I always say

00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:35,600

 

2199
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:41,600

I'll take it it's all right so I was

2200
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:41,610
I'll take it it's all right so I was
 

2201
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:42,740
I'll take it it's all right so I was
thinking about what you're saying about

2202
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:42,750
thinking about what you're saying about
 

2203
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:47,440
thinking about what you're saying about
reward and I'm wondering first of all is

2204
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:47,450
reward and I'm wondering first of all is
 

2205
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:50,060
reward and I'm wondering first of all is
he described as a return to a lo stasis

2206
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:50,070
he described as a return to a lo stasis
 

2207
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:56,720
he described as a return to a lo stasis
is reward in any way linked to the and

2208
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:56,730
is reward in any way linked to the and
 

2209
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:59,090
is reward in any way linked to the and
just like the reinforcement of pathways

2210
00:50:59,090 --> 00:50:59,100
just like the reinforcement of pathways
 

2211
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,550
just like the reinforcement of pathways
or behavior so that the next time you

2212
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:01,560
or behavior so that the next time you
 

2213
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,130
or behavior so that the next time you
get that stimulus you will you'll

2214
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:04,140
get that stimulus you will you'll
 

2215
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,830
get that stimulus you will you'll
respond in the same way and I'm also

2216
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:06,840
respond in the same way and I'm also
 

2217
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,610
respond in the same way and I'm also
wondering about the link between the

2218
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:10,620
wondering about the link between the
 

2219
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:14,140
wondering about the link between the
desire for aloe stasis and the need for

2220
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:14,150
desire for aloe stasis and the need for
 

2221
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:17,270
desire for aloe stasis and the need for
novelty and then he did like a great

2222
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:17,280
novelty and then he did like a great
 

2223
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,320
novelty and then he did like a great
it's a really great question

2224
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:18,330
it's a really great question
 

2225
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:22,610
it's a really great question
so um the second question is so much

2226
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:22,620
so um the second question is so much
 

2227
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,380
so um the second question is so much
more interesting than the first actually

2228
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:24,390
more interesting than the first actually
 

2229
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:30,020
more interesting than the first actually
so let me say this that that there is a

2230
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:30,030
so let me say this that that there is a
 

2231
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:34,400
so let me say this that that there is a
need for novelty the need differs right

2232
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:34,410
need for novelty the need differs right
 

2233
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:37,510
need for novelty the need differs right
for different people I will say novelty

2234
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:37,520
for different people I will say novelty
 

2235
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:44,660
for different people I will say novelty
so first of all the we can think about

2236
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:44,670
so first of all the we can think about
 

2237
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:47,650
so first of all the we can think about
the need for novelty in a really

2238
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:47,660
the need for novelty in a really
 

2239
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:50,120
the need for novelty in a really
proximal way we can think about it in a

2240
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:50,130
proximal way we can think about it in a
 

2241
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:55,990
proximal way we can think about it in a
really distal way like but basically

2242
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:56,000
really distal way like but basically
 

2243
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,910
really distal way like but basically
when I say that a brain is organized or

2244
00:51:58,910 --> 00:51:58,920
when I say that a brain is organized or
 

2245
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,880
when I say that a brain is organized or
engineered for metabolic efficiency that

2246
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:01,890
engineered for metabolic efficiency that
 

2247
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:04,970
engineered for metabolic efficiency that
doesn't mean that the goal is to to only

2248
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:04,980
doesn't mean that the goal is to to only
 

2249
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:09,080
doesn't mean that the goal is to to only
ever have your prediction you know your

2250
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:09,090
ever have your prediction you know your
 

2251
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:10,670
ever have your prediction you know your
brains predicting all the time to always

2252
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:10,680
brains predicting all the time to always
 

2253
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,830
brains predicting all the time to always
have its predictions completely perfect

2254
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:12,840
have its predictions completely perfect
 

2255
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,510
have its predictions completely perfect
so you'll never learn nothing because

2256
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:14,520
so you'll never learn nothing because
 

2257
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,340
so you'll never learn nothing because
you'll be bored out of your mind right

2258
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:16,350
you'll be bored out of your mind right
 

2259
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:22,490
you'll be bored out of your mind right
and also you know humans like to

2260
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:22,500
and also you know humans like to
 

2261
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,520
and also you know humans like to
and their niche they like to explore so

2262
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:25,530
and their niche they like to explore so
 

2263
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:28,870
and their niche they like to explore so
it's a constant balance between what

2264
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:28,880
it's a constant balance between what
 

2265
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,900
it's a constant balance between what
biologists would call exploitation and

2266
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:31,910
biologists would call exploitation and
 

2267
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:36,710
biologists would call exploitation and
exploration novelty is is um it's

2268
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:36,720
exploration novelty is is um it's
 

2269
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,230
exploration novelty is is um it's
exciting it there's actually an increase

2270
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:39,240
exciting it there's actually an increase
 

2271
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,270
exciting it there's actually an increase
in norepinephrine an increase in arousal

2272
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:41,280
in norepinephrine an increase in arousal
 

2273
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,630
in norepinephrine an increase in arousal
it feels really exciting but it's also

2274
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:44,640
it feels really exciting but it's also
 

2275
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,560
it feels really exciting but it's also
super costly novelty requires usually

2276
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:48,570
super costly novelty requires usually
 

2277
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:52,220
super costly novelty requires usually
that you learn something new that means

2278
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:52,230
that you learn something new that means
 

2279
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:53,690
that you learn something new that means
that's actually really metabolically

2280
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:53,700
that's actually really metabolically
 

2281
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,630
that's actually really metabolically
expensive thing to do and it also means

2282
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:56,640
expensive thing to do and it also means
 

2283
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,950
expensive thing to do and it also means
usually that you're moving your body

2284
00:52:57,950 --> 00:52:57,960
usually that you're moving your body
 

2285
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,780
usually that you're moving your body
around which is also metabolically

2286
00:52:59,780 --> 00:52:59,790
around which is also metabolically
 

2287
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:02,540
around which is also metabolically
expensive thing to do so the need for

2288
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:02,550
expensive thing to do so the need for
 

2289
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:07,120
expensive thing to do so the need for
novelty is balanced by its cost and

2290
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:07,130
novelty is balanced by its cost and
 

2291
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:10,480
novelty is balanced by its cost and
different nervous systems can bear

2292
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:10,490
different nervous systems can bear
 

2293
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:13,400
different nervous systems can bear
different amounts of cost so for example

2294
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:13,410
different amounts of cost so for example
 

2295
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:17,930
different amounts of cost so for example
if you take two rats that are somewhat

2296
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:17,940
if you take two rats that are somewhat
 

2297
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,610
if you take two rats that are somewhat
genetically you know moderate like

2298
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:19,620
genetically you know moderate like
 

2299
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,740
genetically you know moderate like
they've been genetically bred one is

2300
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:21,750
they've been genetically bred one is
 

2301
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:26,360
they've been genetically bred one is
bred when you stick it in a a novel cage

2302
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:26,370
bred when you stick it in a a novel cage
 

2303
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:30,380
bred when you stick it in a a novel cage
it just sits still and the other one

2304
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:30,390
it just sits still and the other one
 

2305
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:32,270
it just sits still and the other one
when you put it a novel cage it like

2306
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:32,280
when you put it a novel cage it like
 

2307
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,430
when you put it a novel cage it like
roams all over the place and it's just

2308
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:34,440
roams all over the place and it's just
 

2309
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,630
roams all over the place and it's just
you know it's going crazy kind of

2310
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:35,640
you know it's going crazy kind of
 

2311
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,360
you know it's going crazy kind of
exploring everything well the one that

2312
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:38,370
exploring everything well the one that
 

2313
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:40,190
exploring everything well the one that
sits still scientists might say oh

2314
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:40,200
sits still scientists might say oh
 

2315
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,460
sits still scientists might say oh
that's a nervous rat or that rats afraid

2316
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:43,470
that's a nervous rat or that rats afraid
 

2317
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,920
that's a nervous rat or that rats afraid
what is that rat doing the rat is not

2318
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:45,930
what is that rat doing the rat is not
 

2319
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:48,590
what is that rat doing the rat is not
moving and it's not encoding anything

2320
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:48,600
moving and it's not encoding anything
 

2321
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,540
moving and it's not encoding anything
because encoding something is expense

2322
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:50,550
because encoding something is expense
 

2323
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:52,090
because encoding something is expense
it's expensive

2324
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:52,100
it's expensive
 

2325
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:56,180
it's expensive

have to conserve when I talk to the

have to conserve when I talk to the
 

2347
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,760
have to conserve when I talk to the
public I always talk about I don't use

the word out of stasis it's just too
 

2351
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,680
the word out of stasis it's just too
boring a word but I sort of do is sort

of explain it like a budget you know

2354
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:23,310
of explain it like a budget you know
 

2355
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:25,340

financial office of a company a company

2358
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:28,230
financial office of a company a company
 

2359
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:30,410
financial office of a company a company
has lots of offices it has to balance

2360
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:30,420
has lots of offices it has to balance
 

2361
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:33,350
has lots of offices it has to balance
the expenditures and revenues and it's

2362
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:33,360
the expenditures and revenues and it's
 

2363
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,550
the expenditures and revenues and it's
got to keep everything in balance so it

2364
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:34,560
got to keep everything in balance so it
 

2365
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,859
got to keep everything in balance so it
might take a little money here move

2366
00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:35,869
might take a little money here move
 

2367
00:54:35,869 --> 00:54:37,269
might take a little money here move
without office you know it's got to keep

2368
00:54:37,269 --> 00:54:37,279
without office you know it's got to keep
 

2369
00:54:37,279 --> 00:54:38,829
without office you know it's got to keep
everything in balance we're just always

2370
00:54:38,829 --> 00:54:38,839
everything in balance we're just always
 

2371
00:54:38,839 --> 00:54:40,660
everything in balance we're just always
trying to do is spend a little bit to

2372
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:40,670
trying to do is spend a little bit to
 

2373
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:44,049
trying to do is spend a little bit to
make a little bit more what happens when

2374
00:54:44,049 --> 00:54:44,059
make a little bit more what happens when
 

2375
00:54:44,059 --> 00:54:45,700
make a little bit more what happens when
it spends a little bit and it doesn't

2376
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:45,710
it spends a little bit and it doesn't
 

2377
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:47,140
it spends a little bit and it doesn't
get a revenue back there's no reward

2378
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:47,150
get a revenue back there's no reward
 

2379
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:48,940
get a revenue back there's no reward
what happens well it goes into the read

2380
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:48,950
what happens well it goes into the read
 

2381
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:50,410
what happens well it goes into the read
a little bit so what do you do when

2382
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:50,420
a little bit so what do you do when
 

2383
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:51,670
a little bit so what do you do when
something goes into the read well you

2384
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:51,680
something goes into the read well you
 

2385
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,380
something goes into the read well you
might do something risky you might

2386
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:53,390
might do something risky you might
 

2387
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:56,499
might do something risky you might
actually spend a lot to try to really

2388
00:54:56,499 --> 00:54:56,509
actually spend a lot to try to really
 

2389
00:54:56,509 --> 00:54:58,089
actually spend a lot to try to really
may you know not just make back your

2390
00:54:58,089 --> 00:54:58,099
may you know not just make back your
 

2391
00:54:58,099 --> 00:55:00,130
may you know not just make back your
deficit but actually make a lot that

2392
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:00,140
deficit but actually make a lot that
 

2393
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,230
deficit but actually make a lot that
would be novelty that would be move and

2394
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:02,240
would be novelty that would be move and
 

2395
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,049
would be novelty that would be move and
spent moving and encode or you might

2396
00:55:05,049 --> 00:55:05,059
spent moving and encode or you might
 

2397
00:55:05,059 --> 00:55:07,920
spent moving and encode or you might
reduce your spending you might say well

2398
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:07,930
reduce your spending you might say well
 

2399
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:10,450
reduce your spending you might say well
I'm gonna save a little bit now that

2400
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:10,460
I'm gonna save a little bit now that
 

2401
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:13,749
I'm gonna save a little bit now that
would be I'm not gonna move too much I'm

2402
00:55:13,749 --> 00:55:13,759
would be I'm not gonna move too much I'm
 

2403
00:55:13,759 --> 00:55:15,370
would be I'm not gonna move too much I'm
not gonna spend too much I'm not gonna

2404
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:15,380
not gonna spend too much I'm not gonna
 

2405
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:18,370
not gonna spend too much I'm not gonna
encode anything so I certainly don't

2406
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:18,380
encode anything so I certainly don't
 

2407
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:21,730
encode anything so I certainly don't
mean to suggest to you that that novelty

2408
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:21,740
mean to suggest to you that that novelty
 

2409
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:23,410
mean to suggest to you that that novelty
is unimportant or that learning is

2410
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:23,420
is unimportant or that learning is
 

2411
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:26,499
is unimportant or that learning is
unimportant and it's a really important

2412
00:55:26,499 --> 00:55:26,509
unimportant and it's a really important
 

2413
00:55:26,509 --> 00:55:29,680
unimportant and it's a really important
question about what is there any

2414
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:29,690
question about what is there any
 

2415
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:35,499
question about what is there any
intrinsic value to novelty over and

2416
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:35,509
intrinsic value to novelty over and
 

2417
00:55:35,509 --> 00:55:38,499
intrinsic value to novelty over and
above the rewards that it would give you

2418
00:55:38,499 --> 00:55:38,509
above the rewards that it would give you
 

2419
00:55:38,509 --> 00:55:42,130
above the rewards that it would give you
an analysis at ik sense but it is really

2420
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:42,140
an analysis at ik sense but it is really
 

2421
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:46,140
an analysis at ik sense but it is really
clear to me that the extent to which you

2422
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:46,150
clear to me that the extent to which you
 

2423
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:50,829
clear to me that the extent to which you
any nervous system will embrace novelty

2424
00:55:50,829 --> 00:55:50,839
any nervous system will embrace novelty
 

2425
00:55:50,839 --> 00:55:53,319
any nervous system will embrace novelty
and even seek it pretty much depends on

2426
00:55:53,319 --> 00:55:53,329
and even seek it pretty much depends on
 

2427
00:55:53,329 --> 00:55:56,440
and even seek it pretty much depends on
the allostatic state of that of that

2428
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:56,450
the allostatic state of that of that
 

2429
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:58,599
the allostatic state of that of that
system if you don't have a lot to spend

2430
00:55:58,599 --> 00:55:58,609
system if you don't have a lot to spend
 

2431
00:55:58,609 --> 00:56:01,930
system if you don't have a lot to spend
and you're already in the red you if you

2432
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:01,940
and you're already in the red you if you
 

2433
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:03,880
and you're already in the red you if you
at a certain point if you continue to

at a certain point if you continue to
 

2435
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:05,410
at a certain point if you continue to
spend when you're in the red you go

bankrupt what that means in human terms

2438
00:56:08,019 --> 00:56:08,029
bankrupt what that means in human terms
 

2439
00:56:08,029 --> 00:56:10,569
bankrupt what that means in human terms
is you get depressed it means that your

2440
00:56:10,569 --> 00:56:10,579
is you get depressed it means that your
 

2441
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:12,279
is you get depressed it means that your
your brain makes you fatigued so you

2442
00:56:12,279 --> 00:56:12,289
your brain makes you fatigued so you
 

2443
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:15,849
your brain makes you fatigued so you
can't move and it makes you locks you in

2444
00:56:15,849 --> 00:56:15,859
can't move and it makes you locks you in
 

2445
00:56:15,859 --> 00:56:17,410
can't move and it makes you locks you in
so you stop paying attention to anything

2446
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:17,420
so you stop paying attention to anything
 

2447
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:19,239
so you stop paying attention to anything
going on around you in the world and

2448
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:19,249
going on around you in the world and
 

2449
00:56:19,249 --> 00:56:21,910
going on around you in the world and
your experience is just what's in your

2450
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:21,920
your experience is just what's in your
 

2451
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,380
your experience is just what's in your
head that that's actually what

2452
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:23,390
head that that's actually what
 

2453
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:27,640
head that that's actually what
depression is so that makes me think of

2454
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:27,650
depression is so that makes me think of
 

2455
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,339
depression is so that makes me think of
aloe stasis more of as a range than as a

2456
00:56:30,339 --> 00:56:30,349
aloe stasis more of as a range than as a
 

2457
00:56:30,349 --> 00:56:32,950
aloe stasis more of as a range than as a
zero point it's not homeostasis it's

2458
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:32,960
zero point it's not homeostasis it's
 

2459
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,349
zero point it's not homeostasis it's
Alice stasis it's a range for sure but

2460
00:56:35,349 --> 00:56:35,359
Alice stasis it's a range for sure but
 

2461
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,839
Alice stasis it's a range for sure but
we answer some other questions and maybe

2462
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:37,849
we answer some other questions and maybe
 

2463
00:56:37,849 --> 00:56:39,430
we answer some other questions and maybe
I'll get back to your first question if

2464
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:39,440
I'll get back to your first question if
 

2465
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,759
I'll get back to your first question if
there's time so if I understand your

2466
00:56:42,759 --> 00:56:42,769
there's time so if I understand your
 

2467
00:56:42,769 --> 00:56:44,859
there's time so if I understand your
argument correctly if we're going to

2468
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:44,869
argument correctly if we're going to
 

2469
00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:46,599
argument correctly if we're going to
make anything like a general

2470
00:56:46,599 --> 00:56:46,609
make anything like a general
 

2471
00:56:46,609 --> 00:56:48,090
make anything like a general
intelligence something

2472
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:48,100
intelligence something
 

2473
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:53,460
intelligence something
approaching not like like a human it

2474
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:53,470
approaching not like like a human it
 

2475
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:55,860
approaching not like like a human it
needs to be an embodied system well I

2476
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:55,870
needs to be an embodied system well I
 

2477
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,420
needs to be an embodied system well I
want to be careful about saying that

2478
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:57,430
want to be careful about saying that
 

2479
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:59,690
want to be careful about saying that
because for two reasons one because in

2480
00:56:59,690 --> 00:56:59,700
because for two reasons one because in
 

2481
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,800
because for two reasons one because in
biology there is this concept of

2482
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:01,810
biology there is this concept of
 

2483
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:04,710
biology there is this concept of
degeneracy just a sucky word but it's a

2484
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:04,720
degeneracy just a sucky word but it's a
 

2485
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,900
degeneracy just a sucky word but it's a
great concept and it means that there's

2486
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:06,910
great concept and it means that there's
 

2487
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:08,700
great concept and it means that there's
more than one way to skin a cat

2488
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:08,710
more than one way to skin a cat
 

2489
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:10,800
more than one way to skin a cat
basically you want a functional outcome

2490
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:10,810
basically you want a functional outcome
 

2491
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:12,480
basically you want a functional outcome
there are many ways to get to that

2492
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:12,490
there are many ways to get to that
 

2493
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:14,480
there are many ways to get to that
functional outcome so genes for example

2494
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:14,490
functional outcome so genes for example
 

2495
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:16,340
functional outcome so genes for example
you know there are a lot of

2496
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:16,350
you know there are a lot of
 

2497
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,840
you know there are a lot of
characteristics that are heritable but

2498
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:18,850
characteristics that are heritable but
 

2499
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:20,490
characteristics that are heritable but
we don't know the genes for them and the

2500
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:20,500
we don't know the genes for them and the
 

2501
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,960
we don't know the genes for them and the
reason why is that there isn't one set

2502
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:21,970
reason why is that there isn't one set
 

2503
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:23,640
reason why is that there isn't one set
of genes there are like multiple sets of

2504
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:23,650
of genes there are like multiple sets of
 

2505
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:25,350
of genes there are like multiple sets of
genes that can give you actually the

2506
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:25,360
genes that can give you actually the
 

2507
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,050
genes that can give you actually the
same outcome so what I want to say is

2508
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:28,060
same outcome so what I want to say is
 

2509
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:32,160
same outcome so what I want to say is
that you need something akin to a body

2510
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:32,170
that you need something akin to a body
 

2511
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:34,590
that you need something akin to a body
it doesn't actually have to be a body I

2512
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:34,600
it doesn't actually have to be a body I
 

2513
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,080
it doesn't actually have to be a body I
imagine there are lots of ways that you

2514
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:37,090
imagine there are lots of ways that you
 

2515
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:39,600
imagine there are lots of ways that you
could implement a system you could

2516
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:39,610
could implement a system you could
 

2517
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:41,340
could implement a system you could
implement an agent that has multiple

2518
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:41,350
implement an agent that has multiple
 

2519
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:43,890
implement an agent that has multiple
systems of some sort that it has to

2520
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:43,900
systems of some sort that it has to
 

2521
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:47,370
systems of some sort that it has to
manage but my point is that one thing

2522
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:47,380
manage but my point is that one thing
 

2523
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,890
manage but my point is that one thing
about that is very important that we

2524
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:49,900
about that is very important that we
 

2525
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,320
about that is very important that we
continually miss when we think about

2526
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:52,330
continually miss when we think about
 

2527
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:55,170
continually miss when we think about
building an agent with mental states we

2528
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:55,180
building an agent with mental states we
 

2529
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,210
building an agent with mental states we
continually miss the fact that it has a

2530
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:57,220
continually miss the fact that it has a
 

2531
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:00,240
continually miss the fact that it has a
body it has about humans have bodies and

2532
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:00,250
body it has about humans have bodies and
 

2533
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:03,180
body it has about humans have bodies and
that's the brains primary task and our

2534
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:03,190
that's the brains primary task and our
 

2535
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:05,820
that's the brains primary task and our
most fundamental feelings come from the

2536
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:05,830
most fundamental feelings come from the
 

2537
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:07,800
most fundamental feelings come from the
physical changes in our body even though

2538
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:07,810
physical changes in our body even though
 

2539
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:11,160
physical changes in our body even though
we don't normally experience it that way

2540
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:11,170
we don't normally experience it that way
 

2541
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:13,380
we don't normally experience it that way
that actually is how it is if you just

2542
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:13,390
that actually is how it is if you just
 

2543
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:14,880
that actually is how it is if you just
look at the wiring of the brain if you

2544
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:14,890
look at the wiring of the brain if you
 

2545
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:17,730
look at the wiring of the brain if you
just see it so it seems to me that if

2546
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:17,740
just see it so it seems to me that if
 

2547
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:19,500
just see it so it seems to me that if
you want to build an agent that is human

2548
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:19,510
you want to build an agent that is human
 

2549
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:22,830
you want to build an agent that is human
like it has to have something like a

2550
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:22,840
like it has to have something like a
 

2551
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:26,310
like it has to have something like a
body doesn't have to maybe be a body and

2552
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:26,320
body doesn't have to maybe be a body and
 

2553
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,050
body doesn't have to maybe be a body and
I'm sure there are many clever ways that

2554
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:28,060
I'm sure there are many clever ways that
 

2555
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,610
I'm sure there are many clever ways that
you could implement something like a

2556
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:29,620
you could implement something like a
 

2557
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:32,760
you could implement something like a
body without it actually being a body if

2558
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:32,770
body without it actually being a body if
 

2559
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:34,190
body without it actually being a body if
you know if you understand what I mean

2560
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:34,200
you know if you understand what I mean
 

2561
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:40,290
you know if you understand what I mean
so Amazon Alexa could be there if we

2562
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:40,300
so Amazon Alexa could be there if we
 

2563
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,870
so Amazon Alexa could be there if we
just gave it some sort of I don't know

2564
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:42,880
just gave it some sort of I don't know
 

2565
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,030
just gave it some sort of I don't know
representation of mental states or some

2566
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:45,040
representation of mental states or some
 

2567
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:50,330
representation of mental states or some
kind of a low static yeah target sure

2568
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:50,340

 

2569
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:52,530

here's just say one other thing because

2570
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:52,540
here's just say one other thing because
 

2571
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:55,200
here's just say one other thing because
I think it's really important all a

2572
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:55,210
I think it's really important all a
 

2573
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:57,780
I think it's really important all a
brain requires is that you at some point

2574
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:57,790
brain requires is that you at some point
 

2575
00:58:57,790 --> 00:59:01,400
brain requires is that you at some point
had a body you know right so basically

2576
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:01,410
had a body you know right so basically
 

2577
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:04,920
had a body you know right so basically
being this is what phantom limb pain is

2578
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:04,930
being this is what phantom limb pain is
 

2579
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:07,800
being this is what phantom limb pain is
this is what chronic pain is this is

2580
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:07,810
this is what chronic pain is this is
 

2581
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:09,359
this is what chronic pain is this is
what happened you know if at some point

2582
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:09,369
what happened you know if at some point
 

2583
00:59:09,369 --> 00:59:12,570
what happened you know if at some point
you cease to get information from your

2584
00:59:12,570 --> 00:59:12,580
you cease to get information from your
 

2585
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:15,330
you cease to get information from your
body anymore your brain still can

2586
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:15,340
body anymore your brain still can
 

2587
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:18,870
body anymore your brain still can
simulate still can reinstate the sensory

2588
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:18,880
simulate still can reinstate the sensory
 

2589
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,970
simulate still can reinstate the sensory
patterns that once came from the body

2590
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:20,980
patterns that once came from the body
 

2591
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:24,839
patterns that once came from the body
and that's what's required right at some

2592
00:59:24,839 --> 00:59:24,849
and that's what's required right at some
 

2593
00:59:24,849 --> 00:59:27,000
and that's what's required right at some
point the body isn't really needed

2594
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:27,010
point the body isn't really needed
 

2595
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:32,130
point the body isn't really needed
anymore yeah I think we're here yeah so

2596
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:32,140
anymore yeah I think we're here yeah so
 

2597
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,470
anymore yeah I think we're here yeah so
emotions in humans Lucas are they

2598
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:34,480
emotions in humans Lucas are they
 

2599
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,450
emotions in humans Lucas are they
implemented by a bunch of hacks so

2600
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:36,460
implemented by a bunch of hacks so
 

2601
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:38,310
implemented by a bunch of hacks so
there's a bunch of chemicals that go

2602
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:38,320
there's a bunch of chemicals that go
 

2603
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:42,540
there's a bunch of chemicals that go
into your brain those oxytocin serotonin

2604
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:42,550
into your brain those oxytocin serotonin
 

2605
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:46,020
into your brain those oxytocin serotonin
a whole bunch of biochemical things that

2606
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:46,030
a whole bunch of biochemical things that
 

2607
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:47,400
a whole bunch of biochemical things that
diffuse around in the fluids in your

2608
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:47,410
diffuse around in the fluids in your
 

2609
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:49,200
diffuse around in the fluids in your
brain that affect your emotional state

2610
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:49,210
brain that affect your emotional state
 

2611
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:51,150
brain that affect your emotional state
and that seems like a Hank that we've

2612
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:51,160
and that seems like a Hank that we've
 

2613
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,280
and that seems like a Hank that we've
inherited over millions of years from

2614
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:53,290
inherited over millions of years from
 

2615
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:56,579
inherited over millions of years from
premature ancestors and if you look at

2616
00:59:56,579 --> 00:59:56,589
premature ancestors and if you look at
 

2617
00:59:56,589 --> 00:59:58,200
premature ancestors and if you look at
the machine learning world we can do a

2618
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:58,210
the machine learning world we can do a
 

2619
00:59:58,210 --> 00:59:59,460
the machine learning world we can do a
bunch of similar things with you on that

2620
00:59:59,460 --> 00:59:59,470
bunch of similar things with you on that
 

2621
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,690
bunch of similar things with you on that
so you can increase the activation

2622
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:00,700
so you can increase the activation
 

2623
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:03,870
so you can increase the activation
thresholds on a large scale you have

2624
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:03,880
thresholds on a large scale you have
 

2625
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,910
thresholds on a large scale you have
changed the map noise going into the

2626
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:05,920
changed the map noise going into the
 

2627
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,530
changed the map noise going into the
system you can do a bunch of similar

2628
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:07,540
system you can do a bunch of similar
 

2629
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:10,160
system you can do a bunch of similar
things but you don't have to rely on

2630
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:10,170
things but you don't have to rely on
 

2631
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:13,589
things but you don't have to rely on
fluids being kind of cleaned slowly by

2632
01:00:13,589 --> 01:00:13,599
fluids being kind of cleaned slowly by
 

2633
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:16,290
fluids being kind of cleaned slowly by
glial cells things don't diffuse around

2634
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:16,300
glial cells things don't diffuse around
 

2635
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:18,720
glial cells things don't diffuse around
in and fluid in the system necessarily

2636
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:18,730
in and fluid in the system necessarily
 

2637
01:00:18,730 --> 01:00:19,770
in and fluid in the system necessarily
seems like there's a lot more

2638
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:19,780
seems like there's a lot more
 

2639
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:22,589
seems like there's a lot more
flexibility so when you come to an

2640
01:00:22,589 --> 01:00:22,599
flexibility so when you come to an
 

2641
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:23,790
flexibility so when you come to an
implementation there's not so many

2642
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:23,800
implementation there's not so many
 

2643
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,730
implementation there's not so many
constraints imposed by the evolutionary

2644
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:26,740
constraints imposed by the evolutionary
 

2645
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:29,040
constraints imposed by the evolutionary
history on the whole system and it seems

2646
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:29,050
history on the whole system and it seems
 

2647
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:30,480
history on the whole system and it seems
like that would make it work better so

2648
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:30,490
like that would make it work better so
 

2649
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:32,130
like that would make it work better so
when people are in negative emotional

2650
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:32,140
when people are in negative emotional
 

2651
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:35,480
when people are in negative emotional
states and they can't think straight

2652
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:35,490
states and they can't think straight
 

2653
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:37,920
states and they can't think straight
people can think actually quite well a

2654
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:37,930
people can think actually quite well a
 

2655
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:39,359
people can think actually quite well a
negative emotional state they don't tell

2656
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:39,369
negative emotional state they don't tell
 

2657
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:42,390
negative emotional state they don't tell
you so but they can play with crimes

2658
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:42,400
you so but they can play with crimes
 

2659
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,730
you so but they can play with crimes
they can do very nefarious things very

2660
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:44,740
they can do very nefarious things very
 

2661
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:46,740
they can do very nefarious things very
very effectively right so but the

2662
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:46,750
very effectively right so but the
 

2663
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,990
very effectively right so but the
general point I think is true even if

2664
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:49,000
general point I think is true even if
 

2665
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,040
general point I think is true even if
that example is not so emotions kind of

2666
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:53,050
that example is not so emotions kind of
 

2667
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:54,810
that example is not so emotions kind of
flood your nervous system without

2668
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:54,820
flood your nervous system without
 

2669
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:56,280
flood your nervous system without
emotions don't flood your nervousness

2670
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:56,290
emotions don't flood your nervousness
 

2671
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:58,680
emotions don't flood your nervousness
all right so some of them do so now

2672
01:00:58,680 --> 01:00:58,690
all right so some of them do so now
 

2673
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:00,980
all right so some of them do so now
perfectly of yes sir

2674
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:00,990
perfectly of yes sir
 

2675
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:05,420
perfectly of yes sir
you thing in your bloodstream let's talk

2676
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:05,430
you thing in your bloodstream let's talk
 

2677
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:06,650
you thing in your bloodstream let's talk
about this chemical let's talk about

2678
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:06,660
about this chemical let's talk about
 

2679
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:07,940
about this chemical let's talk about
this chemical there's not a single

2680
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:07,950
this chemical there's not a single
 

2681
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:09,800
this chemical there's not a single
chemical in your brain or anywhere in

2682
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:09,810
chemical in your brain or anywhere in
 

2683
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:12,609
chemical in your brain or anywhere in
your nervous system that is for emotion

2684
01:01:12,609 --> 01:01:12,619
your nervous system that is for emotion
 

2685
01:01:12,619 --> 01:01:15,080
your nervous system that is for emotion
serotonin is not for emotion don't mean

2686
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:15,090
serotonin is not for emotion don't mean
 

2687
01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:17,300
serotonin is not for emotion don't mean
it's not for emotion oxytocin is not for

2688
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:17,310
it's not for emotion oxytocin is not for
 

2689
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:20,030
it's not for emotion oxytocin is not for
emotion well even opioid you know even

2690
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:20,040
emotion well even opioid you know even
 

2691
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,160
emotion well even opioid you know even
even Opie even opioids are not for

2692
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:22,170
even Opie even opioids are not for
 

2693
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:24,560
even Opie even opioids are not for
emotion so they influence your emotions

2694
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:24,570
emotion so they influence your emotions
 

2695
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:26,480
emotion so they influence your emotions
they're involved they influence every

2696
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:26,490
they're involved they influence every
 

2697
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:29,390
they're involved they influence every
mental event that you have not just

2698
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:29,400
mental event that you have not just
 

2699
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:32,870
mental event that you have not just
emotion so your brain for example your

2700
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:32,880
emotion so your brain for example your
 

2701
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,590
emotion so your brain for example your
brain is a physical it's a set of

2702
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:36,600
brain is a physical it's a set of
 

2703
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,350
brain is a physical it's a set of
physical cells that are bathed in neuro

2704
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:39,360
physical cells that are bathed in neuro
 

2705
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:41,690
physical cells that are bathed in neuro
chemical systems and the neuro chemical

2706
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:41,700
chemical systems and the neuro chemical
 

2707
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,359
chemical systems and the neuro chemical
systems that you're referring to

2708
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:43,369
systems that you're referring to
 

2709
01:01:43,369 --> 01:01:45,380
systems that you're referring to
basically change the ease with which

2710
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:45,390
basically change the ease with which
 

2711
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:47,480
basically change the ease with which
information is passed back and forth

2712
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:47,490
information is passed back and forth
 

2713
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:49,970
information is passed back and forth
between those neurons that's always true

2714
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:49,980
between those neurons that's always true
 

2715
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:52,520
between those neurons that's always true
it's true regardless of whether the

2716
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:52,530
it's true regardless of whether the
 

2717
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:54,740
it's true regardless of whether the
event is a motion or whether it's a

2718
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:54,750
event is a motion or whether it's a
 

2719
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:57,080
event is a motion or whether it's a
perception or whether it's a thought or

2720
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:57,090
perception or whether it's a thought or
 

2721
01:01:57,090 --> 01:01:59,780
perception or whether it's a thought or
whether it's a belief it's always true

2722
01:01:59,780 --> 01:01:59,790
whether it's a belief it's always true
 

2723
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:03,530
whether it's a belief it's always true
so for example serotonin serotonin is a

2724
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:03,540
so for example serotonin serotonin is a
 

2725
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:07,400
so for example serotonin serotonin is a
neurotransmitter that allows your brain

2726
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:07,410
neurotransmitter that allows your brain
 

2727
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:10,580
neurotransmitter that allows your brain
to delay gratification of a reward it

2728
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:10,590
to delay gratification of a reward it
 

2729
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:14,240
to delay gratification of a reward it
allows you to expend energy now because

2730
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:14,250
allows you to expend energy now because
 

2731
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:16,760
allows you to expend energy now because
you anticipate a reward at some point in

2732
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:16,770
you anticipate a reward at some point in
 

2733
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:19,340
you anticipate a reward at some point in
the future and if you have a deficit in

2734
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:19,350
the future and if you have a deficit in
 

2735
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:22,099
the future and if you have a deficit in
serotonin then you can't do that very

2736
01:02:22,099 --> 01:02:22,109
serotonin then you can't do that very
 

2737
01:02:22,109 --> 01:02:24,410
serotonin then you can't do that very
well and it turns out for humans one of

2738
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:24,420
well and it turns out for humans one of
 

2739
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:27,700
well and it turns out for humans one of
our great superpowers is the ability to

2740
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:27,710
our great superpowers is the ability to
 

2741
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:31,130
our great superpowers is the ability to
do mental time travel to remember in the

2742
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:31,140
do mental time travel to remember in the
 

2743
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:33,859
do mental time travel to remember in the
past and also to do things now because

2744
01:02:33,859 --> 01:02:33,869
past and also to do things now because
 

2745
01:02:33,869 --> 01:02:35,180
past and also to do things now because
we know they're going to have an effect

2746
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:35,190
we know they're going to have an effect
 

2747
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:37,130
we know they're going to have an effect
ten or twenty or fifty or a hundred

2748
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:37,140
ten or twenty or fifty or a hundred
 

2749
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:41,450
ten or twenty or fifty or a hundred
years from now so the the you know in

2750
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:41,460
years from now so the the you know in
 

2751
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:42,800
years from now so the the you know in
when I said you have to have something

2752
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:42,810
when I said you have to have something
 

2753
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:44,780
when I said you have to have something
like a body I'm not saying literally you

2754
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:44,790
like a body I'm not saying literally you
 

2755
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:46,880
like a body I'm not saying literally you
have to have a physical corporeal body

2756
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:46,890
have to have a physical corporeal body
 

2757
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:49,910
have to have a physical corporeal body
I'm saying you have to have you I mean

2758
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:49,920
I'm saying you have to have you I mean
 

2759
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,010
I'm saying you have to have you I mean
it's just a fact it's not an argument

2760
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:52,020
it's just a fact it's not an argument
 

2761
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:55,190
it's just a fact it's not an argument
it's a fact that your brain that brains

2762
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:55,200
it's a fact that your brain that brains
 

2763
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,859
it's a fact that your brain that brains
evolved for the purposes of regulating

2764
01:02:57,859 --> 01:02:57,869
evolved for the purposes of regulating
 

2765
01:02:57,869 --> 01:03:01,790
evolved for the purposes of regulating
multiple systems and from a cybernetics

2766
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:01,800
multiple systems and from a cybernetics
 

2767
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,310
multiple systems and from a cybernetics
standpoint you know the best way to

2768
01:03:04,310 --> 01:03:04,320
standpoint you know the best way to
 

2769
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,750
standpoint you know the best way to
regulate a system is to build an

2770
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:05,760
regulate a system is to build an
 

2771
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,340
regulate a system is to build an
internal model of it that's what your

2772
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:07,350
internal model of it that's what your
 

2773
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:09,200
internal model of it that's what your
brain is your brain is an internal model

2774
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:09,210
brain is your brain is an internal model
 

2775
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:11,120
brain is your brain is an internal model
of your body in the world it's running

2776
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:11,130
of your body in the world it's running
 

2777
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:13,370
of your body in the world it's running
simulations it's running this model and

2778
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:13,380
simulations it's running this model and
 

2779
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,120
simulations it's running this model and
if you want to have an age

2780
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:15,130
if you want to have an age
 

2781
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:17,610
if you want to have an age
that is somewhat human-like that has

2782
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:17,620
that is somewhat human-like that has
 

2783
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:20,100
that is somewhat human-like that has
feelings like humans then they have to

2784
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:20,110
feelings like humans then they have to
 

2785
01:03:20,110 --> 01:03:21,840
feelings like humans then they have to
do something that they have to have to

2786
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:21,850
do something that they have to have to
 

2787
01:03:21,850 --> 01:03:23,220
do something that they have to have to
be able to do something similar and

2788
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:23,230
be able to do something similar and
 

2789
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:25,830
be able to do something similar and
whether it's a actually physical

2790
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:25,840
whether it's a actually physical
 

2791
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,290
whether it's a actually physical
corporeal body or not I think is you

2792
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:28,300
corporeal body or not I think is you
 

2793
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:30,180
corporeal body or not I think is you
know that's an open question right so it

2794
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:30,190
know that's an open question right so it
 

2795
01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:31,290
know that's an open question right so it
sounds a bit as though you're disputing

2796
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:31,300
sounds a bit as though you're disputing
 

2797
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,030
sounds a bit as though you're disputing
my premises before I got to my question

2798
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:33,040
my premises before I got to my question
 

2799
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:36,000
my premises before I got to my question
so I started off by saying sorry I

2800
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:36,010
so I started off by saying sorry I
 

2801
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:38,490
so I started off by saying sorry I
started off by saying emotions are

2802
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:38,500
started off by saying emotions are
 

2803
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,650
started off by saying emotions are
implemented as a bunch of hacks so would

2804
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:40,660
implemented as a bunch of hacks so would
 

2805
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:42,750
implemented as a bunch of hacks so would
you say that was rub broadly correct or

2806
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:42,760
you say that was rub broadly correct or
 

2807
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,150
you say that was rub broadly correct or
would you say that they're not hacks

2808
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:45,160
would you say that they're not hacks
 

2809
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,400
would you say that they're not hacks
they're finely tuned and adaptive and

01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:47,410
they're finely tuned and adaptive and
 

2811
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:49,980
they're finely tuned and adaptive and
well I went there not maladaptive but

2812
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:49,990
well I went there not maladaptive but
 

2813
01:03:49,990 --> 01:03:51,510
well I went there not maladaptive but
would you say it's a bunch of hacks I

would you say it's a bunch of hacks I
don't think I don't know what you mean

2816
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:53,020
don't think I don't know what you mean
 

2817
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:53,700
don't think I don't know what you mean

01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,080
everybody has effect assuming they have
a neurotypical brain of sorts but but

a neurotypical brain of sorts but but
 

2847
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:36,660
a neurotypical brain of sorts but but
they don't all have emotion and so to

01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:36,670
they don't all have emotion and so to
 

2849
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:38,520
they don't all have emotion and so to
answer your question that your answer

2850
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:38,530
answer your question that your answer
 

2851
01:04:38,530 --> 01:04:41,370
answer your question that your answer
asking me is I can't answer because I

2852
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:41,380
asking me is I can't answer because I
 

2853
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:42,930
asking me is I can't answer because I
don't think it's the right I don't think

2854
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:42,940
don't think it's the right I don't think
 

2855
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:45,810
don't think it's the right I don't think
it's the right opioids and the the pain

2856
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:45,820
it's the right opioids and the the pain
 

2857
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:50,460
it's the right opioids and the the pain
systems seem like things that influence

2858
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:50,470
systems seem like things that influence
 

2859
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,500
systems seem like things that influence
your emotions fairly directly so this

2860
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:52,510
your emotions fairly directly so this
 

2861
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:53,880
your emotions fairly directly so this
it's not that it's the same thing but

2862
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:53,890
it's not that it's the same thing but
 

2863
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,060
it's not that it's the same thing but
it's that there's a powerful link

2864
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:56,070
it's that there's a powerful link
 

2865
01:04:56,070 --> 01:05:01,620
it's that there's a powerful link
opioids though so opioids are important

2866
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:01,630
opioids though so opioids are important
 

2867
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:03,720
opioids though so opioids are important
for instances of emotion but they are

2868
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:03,730
for instances of emotion but they are
 

2869
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:07,950
for instances of emotion but they are
also important for every other category

2870
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:07,960
also important for every other category
 

2871
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:10,110
also important for every other category
of mental event that you brain can make

2872
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:10,120
of mental event that you brain can make
 

2873
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:15,030
of mental event that you brain can make
other things too I agree so I you know

2874
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:15,040
other things too I agree so I you know
 

2875
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,640
other things too I agree so I you know
but you will see sometimes scientists

2876
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:17,650
but you will see sometimes scientists
 

2877
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:20,430
but you will see sometimes scientists
will assign you know I'm an emotional

2878
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:20,440
will assign you know I'm an emotional
 

2879
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:23,520
will assign you know I'm an emotional
meaning to something like dopamine is

2880
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:23,530
meaning to something like dopamine is
 

2881
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:25,830
meaning to something like dopamine is
for you know first hedonic pleasantness

2882
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:25,840
for you know first hedonic pleasantness
 

2883
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:28,170
for you know first hedonic pleasantness
and then it's for reward people like to

2884
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:28,180
and then it's for reward people like to
 

2885
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:28,590
and then it's for reward people like to
assign

2886
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:28,600
assign
 

2887
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:33,450
assign
single functions two biological entities

2888

single functions two biological entities
 

2889
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:35,760
single functions two biological entities
like a chemical or a brain region a

2890
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:35,770
like a chemical or a brain region a
 

2891
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:38,730
like a chemical or a brain region a
cluster of neurons or it's just not

01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:38,740
cluster of neurons or it's just not
 

2893
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:40,770
cluster of neurons or it's just not
that's really I'm not saying every

2894
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:40,780
that's really I'm not saying every
 

2895
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:42,900
that's really I'm not saying every
chemical does everything but whatever

2896

whatever opioids do they do in every
 

2899
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:49,230
whatever opioids do they do in every
waking moment of your life not just in

2900
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:49,240
waking moment of your life not just in
 

2901
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:52,200
waking moment of your life not just in
moments that are emotional for you

2902
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:52,210
moments that are emotional for you
 

2903
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:58,110
moments that are emotional for you
I should stop thank you very much yep I

2904
01:05:58,110 --> 01:05:58,120
I should stop thank you very much yep I
 

2905
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,480
I should stop thank you very much yep I
think it is very interesting that you

2906
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:00,490
think it is very interesting that you
 

2907
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:01,950
think it is very interesting that you
brought up the last topic of love

2908
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:01,960
brought up the last topic of love
 

2909
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,840
brought up the last topic of love
because I think it actually brings up a

2910
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:03,850
because I think it actually brings up a
 

2911
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:06,450
because I think it actually brings up a
really important thing which is and what

2912
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:06,460
really important thing which is and what
 

2913
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:10,080
really important thing which is and what
you were saying about connection that's

2914
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:10,090
you were saying about connection that's
 

2915
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:12,930
you were saying about connection that's
I mean the primary purpose of life is to

2916
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:12,940
I mean the primary purpose of life is to
 

2917
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:15,660
I mean the primary purpose of life is to
procreate right I mean that that's what

2918
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:15,670
procreate right I mean that that's what
 

2919
01:06:15,670 --> 01:06:20,280
procreate right I mean that that's what
our genes do so first of all right I'm

2920
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:20,290
our genes do so first of all right I'm
 

2921
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:27,120
our genes do so first of all right I'm
not gonna be touching that yeah so yeah

2922
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:27,130
not gonna be touching that yeah so yeah
 

2923
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:31,230
not gonna be touching that yeah so yeah
and and it's of course in humans it's

2924
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:31,240
and and it's of course in humans it's
 

2925
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,510
and and it's of course in humans it's
not just genetic it's mimetic I mean we

2926
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:33,520
not just genetic it's mimetic I mean we
 

2927
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,230
not just genetic it's mimetic I mean we
appropriated our ideas as well as you

2928
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:37,240
appropriated our ideas as well as you
 

2929
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:40,410
appropriated our ideas as well as you
know physically and so a primary purpose

2930
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:40,420
know physically and so a primary purpose
 

2931
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:45,210
know physically and so a primary purpose
of our wanting our our reactions and

2932
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:45,220
of our wanting our our reactions and
 

2933
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:48,510
of our wanting our our reactions and
interactions with other people and other

2934
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:48,520
interactions with other people and other
 

2935
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:54,120
interactions with other people and other
things is that goal is that we get

2936
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:54,130
things is that goal is that we get
 

2937
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:56,430
things is that goal is that we get
rewarded when we interact with other

2938
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:56,440
rewarded when we interact with other
 

2939
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,680
rewarded when we interact with other
things in a way that creates something

2940
01:06:58,680 --> 01:06:58,690
things in a way that creates something
 

2941
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:02,340
things in a way that creates something
new whether it's art or you know a book

2942
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:02,350
new whether it's art or you know a book
 

2943
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:04,560
new whether it's art or you know a book
or technology or something like that

2944
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:04,570
or technology or something like that
 

2945
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:08,520
or technology or something like that
and if we don't put that if there's no

2946
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:08,530
and if we don't put that if there's no
 

2947
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:12,060
and if we don't put that if there's no
inherent reason for a robot or a

2948
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:12,070
inherent reason for a robot or a
 

2949
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:14,880
inherent reason for a robot or a
computer system to want to do that I

2950
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:14,890
computer system to want to do that I
 

2951
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:18,090
computer system to want to do that I
mean how do we how can we can even

2952
01:07:18,090 --> 01:07:18,100
mean how do we how can we can even
 

2953
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,270
mean how do we how can we can even
imagine

2954
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:20,280
imagine
 

2955
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:23,490
imagine
putting that into a system inherently

2956
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:23,500
putting that into a system inherently
 

2957
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:26,000
putting that into a system inherently
that it wants to that it just

2958
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:26,010
that it wants to that it just
 

2959
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:28,980
that it wants to that it just
desperately wants to make something new

2960
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:28,990
desperately wants to make something new
 

2961
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:32,280
desperately wants to make something new
I mean well here's what I would say you

2962
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:32,290
I mean well here's what I would say you
 

2963
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:34,080
I mean well here's what I would say you
know when we're we're first of all we're

2964
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:34,090
know when we're we're first of all we're
 

2965
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:37,560
know when we're we're first of all we're
not we talk about we've been focusing a

2966
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:37,570
not we talk about we've been focusing a
 

2967
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:39,030
not we talk about we've been focusing a
lot on bodies I'm certainly not saying

2968
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:39,040
lot on bodies I'm certainly not saying
 

2969
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,650
lot on bodies I'm certainly not saying
that's a sufficient condition right I'm

2970
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:40,660
that's a sufficient condition right I'm
 

2971
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:41,590
that's a sufficient condition right I'm
just saying it's a

2972
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:41,600
just saying it's a
 

2973
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,190
just saying it's a
Ceri one or something like a body but I

2974
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:44,200
Ceri one or something like a body but I
 

2975
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:47,680
Ceri one or something like a body but I
certainly have the motivation to create

2976
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:47,690
certainly have the motivation to create
 

2977
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:50,440
certainly have the motivation to create
and I'm imagining that you do too I have

2978
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:50,450
and I'm imagining that you do too I have
 

2979
01:07:50,450 --> 01:07:53,950
and I'm imagining that you do too I have
to tell you not everybody has that most

2980
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:53,960
to tell you not everybody has that most
 

2981
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:56,140
to tell you not everybody has that most
adolescents don't have that many

2982
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:56,150
adolescents don't have that many
 

2983
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:57,730
adolescents don't have that many
adolescents don't have it okay that was

2984
01:07:57,730 --> 01:07:57,740
adolescents don't have it okay that was
 

2985
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:00,010
adolescents don't have it okay that was
a joke I have a teenage daughter I'm

2986
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:00,020
a joke I have a teenage daughter I'm
 

2987
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:03,370
a joke I have a teenage daughter I'm
just telling you yeah but the point is

2988
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:03,380
just telling you yeah but the point is
 

2989
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:07,810
just telling you yeah but the point is
that that what people what people find

2990
01:08:07,810 --> 01:08:07,820
that that what people what people find
 

2991
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:13,080
that that what people what people find
rewarding is is remarkably diverse but

2992
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:13,090
rewarding is is remarkably diverse but
 

2993
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:16,870
rewarding is is remarkably diverse but
the property I think is that there has

2994
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:16,880
the property I think is that there has
 

2995
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,650
the property I think is that there has
to be a feature of reward for for a lot

2996
01:08:20,650 --> 01:08:20,660
to be a feature of reward for for a lot
 

2997
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:22,720
to be a feature of reward for for a lot
of people that's you know that's having

2998
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:22,730
of people that's you know that's having
 

2999
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:25,510
of people that's you know that's having
an impact in some way having an impact

01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:25,520
an impact in some way having an impact
 

3001
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,390
an impact in some way having an impact
on another person having an impact you

3002
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:28,400
on another person having an impact you
 

3003
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,500
on another person having an impact you
know on a building something that wasn't

3004
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:32,510
know on a building something that wasn't
 

3005
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:34,980
know on a building something that wasn't
there before whatever you know in in

01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:34,990

innovating or I'm discovering but it's

3008
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:38,270
innovating or I'm discovering but it's
 

3009
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:39,790

not true for everybody it's just true

3010
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:39,800
not true for everybody it's just true
 

3011
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:42,730
not true for everybody it's just true
for like a lot of people in this room

3012
01:08:42,730 --> 01:08:42,740
for like a lot of people in this room
 

3013
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:44,800
for like a lot of people in this room
probably and certainly the people that

3014
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:44,810
probably and certainly the people that
 

3015
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:46,240
probably and certainly the people that
we probably spend a lot of time with but

3016
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:46,250
we probably spend a lot of time with but
 

3017
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:49,510
we probably spend a lot of time with but
not not for everybody

3018
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:49,520

 

3019
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,030

sure I mean look but if you want to you

3020
01:08:52,030 --> 01:08:52,040
sure I mean look but if you want to you
 

3021
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,860
sure I mean look but if you want to you
know if you want to if you you know we

3022
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:53,870
know if you want to if you you know we
 

3023
01:08:53,870 --> 01:08:56,050
know if you want to if you you know we
can certainly make a kinetic argument

3024
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:56,060
can certainly make a kinetic argument
 

3025
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:56,920
can certainly make a kinetic argument
here absolutely

3026
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:56,930
here absolutely
 

3027
01:08:56,930 --> 01:09:03,640
here absolutely
there there the there's nothing that

3028
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:03,650
there there the there's nothing that
 

3029
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:05,620
there there the there's nothing that
I've said today that is inconsistent

3030
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:05,630
I've said today that is inconsistent
 

3031
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:09,790
I've said today that is inconsistent
with the idea that that you have to that

3032
01:09:09,790 --> 01:09:09,800
with the idea that that you have to that
 

3033
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,200
with the idea that that you have to that
you have to pass your genes on to the

3034
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:11,210
you have to pass your genes on to the
 

3035
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:13,390
you have to pass your genes on to the
next generation and actually make sure

3036
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:13,400
next generation and actually make sure
 

3037
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,460
next generation and actually make sure
that that generation survives to

3038
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:15,470
that that generation survives to
 

3039
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:18,280
that that generation survives to
reproductive age it's not just enough to

3040
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:18,290
reproductive age it's not just enough to
 

3041
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:20,680
reproductive age it's not just enough to
have offspring you have to make sure the

3042
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:20,690
have offspring you have to make sure the
 

3043
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:23,260
have offspring you have to make sure the
offspring survive to reproductive age

3044
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:23,270
offspring survive to reproductive age
 

3045
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:30,430
offspring survive to reproductive age
and there's a whole argument about you

3046
01:09:30,430 --> 01:09:30,440
and there's a whole argument about you
 

3047
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:40,510
and there's a whole argument about you
know the the learning of social reality

3048
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:40,520
know the the learning of social reality
 

3049
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,280
know the the learning of social reality
concepts of social reality that we've

3050
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:42,290
concepts of social reality that we've
 

3051
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:43,510
concepts of social reality that we've
been talking about like money and

3052
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:43,520
been talking about like money and
 

3053
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:46,750
been talking about like money and
emotions and so on that makes that

3054
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:46,760
emotions and so on that makes that
 

3055
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,000
emotions and so on that makes that
argument right that it's very expensive

3056
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:49,010
argument right that it's very expensive
 

3057
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:52,840
argument right that it's very expensive
to have to encode everything in jeans or

3058
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:52,850
to have to encode everything in jeans or
 

3059
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:55,410
to have to encode everything in jeans or
to have to learn everything from scratch

3060
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:55,420
to have to learn everything from scratch
 

3061
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:57,870
to have to learn everything from scratch
every generation so instead what we have

3062
01:09:57,870 --> 01:09:57,880
every generation so instead what we have
 

3063
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:01,200
every generation so instead what we have
is a system a genetic system that allows

3064
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:01,210
is a system a genetic system that allows
 

3065
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:04,200
is a system a genetic system that allows
us to wire the brains of the young with

3066
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:04,210
us to wire the brains of the young with
 

3067
01:10:04,210 --> 01:10:06,390
us to wire the brains of the young with
what we know and that's what we do

3068
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:06,400
what we know and that's what we do
 

3069
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:13,439
what we know and that's what we do
basically right so it's the I'm curious

3070
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:13,449
basically right so it's the I'm curious
 

3071
01:10:13,449 --> 01:10:16,169
basically right so it's the I'm curious
about your analogy about intentionality

3072
01:10:16,169 --> 01:10:16,179
about your analogy about intentionality
 

3073
01:10:16,179 --> 01:10:18,180
about your analogy about intentionality
that you talked about when you use the

3074
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:18,190
that you talked about when you use the
 

3075
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:20,669
that you talked about when you use the
analogy between money and the perception

3076
01:10:20,669 --> 01:10:20,679
analogy between money and the perception
 

3077
01:10:20,679 --> 01:10:24,090
analogy between money and the perception
of red to the facts that we the fact

3078
01:10:24,090 --> 01:10:24,100
of red to the facts that we the fact
 

3079
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:27,390
of red to the facts that we the fact
that we have emotion because the

3080
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:27,400
that we have emotion because the
 

3081
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,250
that we have emotion because the
distinguishing feature it seems to me is

3082
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:29,260
distinguishing feature it seems to me is
 

3083
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:31,590
distinguishing feature it seems to me is
the level of intentionality and as you

3084
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:31,600
the level of intentionality and as you
 

3085
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,590
the level of intentionality and as you
said before our brain assigns meaning to

3086
01:10:34,590 --> 01:10:34,600
said before our brain assigns meaning to
 

3087
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:37,229
said before our brain assigns meaning to
things but we don't or maybe and and my

3088
01:10:37,229 --> 01:10:37,239
things but we don't or maybe and and my
 

3089
01:10:37,239 --> 01:10:38,939
things but we don't or maybe and and my
question is whether or not you agree

3090
01:10:38,939 --> 01:10:38,949
question is whether or not you agree
 

3091
01:10:38,949 --> 01:10:40,800
question is whether or not you agree
with this I guess we don't always

3092
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:40,810
with this I guess we don't always
 

3093
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:44,220
with this I guess we don't always
deliberately assign me nothing I've said

3094
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:44,230
deliberately assign me nothing I've said
 

3095
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:45,959
deliberately assign me nothing I've said
is about ever deliberate but sometimes

3096
01:10:45,959 --> 01:10:45,969
is about ever deliberate but sometimes
 

3097
01:10:45,969 --> 01:10:49,650
is about ever deliberate but sometimes
we do write often actually yeah so when

3098
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:49,660
we do write often actually yeah so when
 

3099
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:51,209
we do write often actually yeah so when
you go back to like the question of what

3100
01:10:51,209 --> 01:10:51,219
you go back to like the question of what
 

3101
01:10:51,219 --> 01:10:53,070
you go back to like the question of what
makes something intelligent a lot of

3102
01:10:53,070 --> 01:10:53,080
makes something intelligent a lot of
 

3103
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:55,320
makes something intelligent a lot of
previous talks have been about you know

3104
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:55,330
previous talks have been about you know
 

3105
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:58,530
previous talks have been about you know
we want to pick a goal and then we

3106
01:10:58,530 --> 01:10:58,540
we want to pick a goal and then we
 

3107
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:00,600
we want to pick a goal and then we
create costs to achieve that goal but

3108
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:00,610
create costs to achieve that goal but
 

3109
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:03,630
create costs to achieve that goal but
that goal is deliberately if assigned so

3110
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:03,640
that goal is deliberately if assigned so
 

3111
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,220
that goal is deliberately if assigned so
when you talk about like what makes

3112
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:05,230
when you talk about like what makes
 

3113
01:11:05,230 --> 01:11:08,729
when you talk about like what makes
something intelligent what do you think

3114
01:11:08,729 --> 01:11:08,739
something intelligent what do you think
 

3115
01:11:08,739 --> 01:11:11,310
something intelligent what do you think
the role of intentionality is and the

3116
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:11,320
the role of intentionality is and the
 

3117
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:13,860
the role of intentionality is and the
spectrum therein so first of all we talk

3118
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:13,870
spectrum therein so first of all we talk
 

3119
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:15,150
spectrum therein so first of all we talk
about intentionality I think you have to

3120
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:15,160
about intentionality I think you have to
 

3121
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,560
about intentionality I think you have to
really be careful that you are

3122
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:16,570
really be careful that you are
 

3123
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:18,419
really be careful that you are
philosophers talk about intentionality

3124
01:11:18,419 --> 01:11:18,429
philosophers talk about intentionality
 

3125
01:11:18,429 --> 01:11:20,820
philosophers talk about intentionality
in two ways they talk about

3126
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:20,830
in two ways they talk about
 

3127
01:11:20,830 --> 01:11:22,530
in two ways they talk about
intentionality to mean a deliberate

3128

intentionality to mean a deliberate
 

3129
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:24,540
intentionality to mean a deliberate
action the way you mean it but

3130
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:24,550
action the way you mean it but
 

3131
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:26,280
action the way you mean it but
intentionality can also mean that

3132
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:26,290
intentionality can also mean that
 

3133
01:11:26,290 --> 01:11:27,930
intentionality can also mean that
something has a referent out in the real

3134
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:27,940
something has a referent out in the real
 

3135
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:30,479
something has a referent out in the real
we're out and outside of you really so

3136
01:11:30,479 --> 01:11:30,489
we're out and outside of you really so
 

3137
01:11:30,489 --> 01:11:33,240
we're out and outside of you really so
that a word a word has a referent that's

3138
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:33,250
that a word a word has a referent that's
 

3139
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:36,300
that a word a word has a referent that's
the you know the intention of the of the

3140
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:36,310
the you know the intention of the of the
 

3141
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:38,220
the you know the intention of the of the
word basically I think you have to be

3142
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:38,230
word basically I think you have to be
 

3143
01:11:38,230 --> 01:11:39,959
word basically I think you have to be
really careful I also think that you

3144
01:11:39,959 --> 01:11:39,969
really careful I also think that you
 

3145
01:11:39,969 --> 01:11:41,490
really careful I also think that you
have to make a distinction between a

3146
01:11:41,490 --> 01:11:41,500
have to make a distinction between a
 

3147
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:48,360
have to make a distinction between a
conscious deliberate explicitly a goal

3148
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:48,370
conscious deliberate explicitly a goal
 

3149
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:56,209
conscious deliberate explicitly a goal
that you can explicitly describe and I

3150
01:11:56,209 --> 01:11:56,219

 

3151
01:11:56,219 --> 01:11:59,700

mean you're you're sort of making you're

3152
01:11:59,700 --> 01:11:59,710
mean you're you're sort of making you're
 

3153
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:01,439
mean you're you're sort of making you're
sort of making I mean wait the kind of

3154
01:12:01,439 --> 01:12:01,449
sort of making I mean wait the kind of
 

3155
01:12:01,449 --> 01:12:03,120
sort of making I mean wait the kind of
question you're asking is getting very

3156
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:03,130
question you're asking is getting very
 

3157
01:12:03,130 --> 01:12:05,459
question you're asking is getting very
close to the question of free will so I

3158
01:12:05,459 --> 01:12:05,469
close to the question of free will so I
 

3159
01:12:05,469 --> 01:12:06,570
close to the question of free will so I
would love to not have

3160
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:06,580
would love to not have
 

3161
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:10,590
would love to not have
disgust but but basically okay and and I

3162
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:10,600
disgust but but basically okay and and I
 

3163
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,030
disgust but but basically okay and and I
what I'm about to say is gonna sound

3164
01:12:12,030 --> 01:12:12,040
what I'm about to say is gonna sound
 

3165
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,460
what I'm about to say is gonna sound
very Cartesian unfortunately because

3166
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:14,470
very Cartesian unfortunately because
 

3167
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:16,500
very Cartesian unfortunately because
that's English I don't know there's no

3168
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:16,510
that's English I don't know there's no
 

3169
01:12:16,510 --> 01:12:18,780
that's English I don't know there's no
other way to do it actually but what I

3170
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:18,790
other way to do it actually but what I
 

3171
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:21,750
other way to do it actually but what I
want to say is that your brain is always

3172
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:21,760
want to say is that your brain is always
 

3173
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:25,710
want to say is that your brain is always
there is always a volition but it's not

3174
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:25,720
there is always a volition but it's not
 

3175
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:27,870
there is always a volition but it's not
always consciously experienced by you as

3176
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:27,880
always consciously experienced by you as
 

3177
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:32,220
always consciously experienced by you as
as agency or will so yeah you're not

3178
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:32,230
as agency or will so yeah you're not
 

3179
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:35,250
as agency or will so yeah you're not
you're not a sea urchin you know your

3180
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:35,260
you're not a sea urchin you know your
 

3181
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:37,440
you're not a sea urchin you know your
sensory neurons are not hardwired to

3182
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:37,450
sensory neurons are not hardwired to
 

3183
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:39,630
sensory neurons are not hardwired to
your motor neurons you have inter

3184
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:39,640
your motor neurons you have inter
 

3185
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:41,850
your motor neurons you have inter
neurons that means you have choice do

3186
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:41,860
neurons that means you have choice do
 

3187
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:43,530
neurons that means you have choice do
you consciously experience yourself as

3188
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:43,540
you consciously experience yourself as
 

3189
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:45,330
you consciously experience yourself as
making choices all the time no you don't

3190
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:45,340
making choices all the time no you don't
 

3191
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:46,890
making choices all the time no you don't
but your brain is actually making

3192
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:46,900
but your brain is actually making
 

3193
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:49,680
but your brain is actually making
choices all the time that's why people

3194
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:49,690
choices all the time that's why people
 

3195
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:52,260
choices all the time that's why people
who study decision making you know think

3196
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:52,270
who study decision making you know think
 

3197
01:12:52,270 --> 01:12:53,700
who study decision making you know think
they're studying the whole brain because

3198
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:53,710
they're studying the whole brain because
 

3199
01:12:53,710 --> 01:12:57,780
they're studying the whole brain because
they they are actually so I think you

3200
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:57,790
they they are actually so I think you
 

3201
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:01,620
they they are actually so I think you
have to be really careful about there

3202
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:01,630
have to be really careful about there
 

3203
01:13:01,630 --> 01:13:04,710
have to be really careful about there
are words that we use in English and in

01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:04,720
are words that we use in English and in
 

3205
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:08,370
are words that we use in English and in
science that have two meanings they can

3206
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:08,380
science that have two meanings they can
 

3207
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:10,560
science that have two meanings they can
have a meaning that is about decision

3208
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:10,570
have a meaning that is about decision
 

3209
01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:13,340
have a meaning that is about decision
making or choice that is just obligatory

making or choice that is just obligatory

automatic and a function of how the
 

3213
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:18,720
automatic and a function of how the
system works and then there's the kind

3214
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:18,730
system works and then there's the kind
 

3215
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:20,610
system works and then there's the kind
of choice that feels deliberate and

3216
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:20,620
of choice that feels deliberate and
 

3217
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:23,040
of choice that feels deliberate and
effortful and where we feel like we're

3218
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:23,050
effortful and where we feel like we're
 

3219
01:13:23,050 --> 01:13:25,050
effortful and where we feel like we're
the agents we experience ourselves as

the agents we experience ourselves as

01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:30,720
the agents we experience ourselves as
the agents and intentionality usually

3222
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:30,730
the agents and intentionality usually
 

3223
01:13:30,730 --> 01:13:32,490
the agents and intentionality usually
can be assigned to the second one but

3224
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:32,500
can be assigned to the second one but
 

3225
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:34,440
can be assigned to the second one but
actually in truth in philosophical terms

3226
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:34,450
actually in truth in philosophical terms
 

3227
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:36,060
actually in truth in philosophical terms
it can also be assigned to the first

3228
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:36,070
it can also be assigned to the first
 

3229
01:13:36,070 --> 01:13:38,400
it can also be assigned to the first
that when you even if you're completely

3230
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:38,410
that when you even if you're completely
 

3231
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:42,120
that when you even if you're completely
unaware of having made a choice you're

3232
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:42,130
unaware of having made a choice you're
 

3233
01:13:42,130 --> 01:13:44,870
unaware of having made a choice you're
acting on something with some degree of

3234
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:44,880
acting on something with some degree of
 

3235
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,420
acting on something with some degree of
volition because you you it's not a

3236
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:48,430
volition because you you it's not a
 

3237
01:13:48,430 --> 01:13:50,550
volition because you you it's not a
reflex it's not like you know somebody

3238
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:50,560
reflex it's not like you know somebody
 

3239
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:53,160
reflex it's not like you know somebody
hit your patellar tendon and nuke it and

3240
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:53,170
hit your patellar tendon and nuke it and
 

3241
01:13:53,170 --> 01:13:55,620
hit your patellar tendon and nuke it and
so it's really interesting so you know I

3242
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:55,630
so it's really interesting so you know I
 

3243
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:57,060
so it's really interesting so you know I
think you just have to you have to make

3244
01:13:57,060 --> 01:13:57,070
think you just have to you have to make
 

3245
01:13:57,070 --> 01:13:58,740
think you just have to you have to make
that distinction and I probably should

3246
01:13:58,740 --> 01:13:58,750
that distinction and I probably should
 

3247
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:00,240
that distinction and I probably should
get to the next question we can question

3248
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:00,250
get to the next question we can question
 

3249
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:03,210
get to the next question we can question
yeah thank you yep yeah so you've been

3250
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:03,220
yeah thank you yep yeah so you've been
 

3251
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:05,190
yeah thank you yep yeah so you've been
asked a lot of esoteric questions about

3252
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:05,200
asked a lot of esoteric questions about
 

3253
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,140
asked a lot of esoteric questions about
AI but I think we might gain some

3254
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:07,150
AI but I think we might gain some
 

3255
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:10,170
AI but I think we might gain some
insights by wondering about di that is a

3256
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:10,180
insights by wondering about di that is a
 

3257
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:12,870
insights by wondering about di that is a
dog intelligence oh sure

3258
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:12,880
dog intelligence oh sure
 

3259
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:17,190
dog intelligence oh sure
so I believe I sort of understand what

3260
01:14:17,190 --> 01:14:17,200
so I believe I sort of understand what
 

3261
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:20,220
so I believe I sort of understand what
my dog is feeling and III usually

3262
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:20,230
my dog is feeling and III usually
 

3263
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:23,070
my dog is feeling and III usually
believe that my dog you know believes

3264
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:23,080
believe that my dog you know believes
 

3265
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:26,640
believe that my dog you know believes
the same but not the same with you know

3266
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:26,650
the same but not the same with you know
 

3267
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:29,360
the same but not the same with you know
a cat because you're not a cat person

3268
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:29,370
a cat because you're not a cat person
 

3269
01:14:29,370 --> 01:14:33,720
a cat because you're not a cat person
yeah sure I mean you know I'm not I

3270
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:33,730
yeah sure I mean you know I'm not I
 

3271
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:36,000
yeah sure I mean you know I'm not I
don't know that much about monkeys but

3272
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:36,010
don't know that much about monkeys but
 

3273
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:37,590
don't know that much about monkeys but
I've never really seen a monkey be able

3274
01:14:37,590 --> 01:14:37,600
I've never really seen a monkey be able
 

3275
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,810
I've never really seen a monkey be able
to make the expressions that let's say a

3276
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:39,820
to make the expressions that let's say a
 

3277
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:43,140
to make the expressions that let's say a
dog can and I was wondering if you had

3278
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:43,150
dog can and I was wondering if you had
 

3279
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:45,420
dog can and I was wondering if you had
any insights about you know why dogs are

3280
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:45,430
any insights about you know why dogs are
 

3281
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:47,250
any insights about you know why dogs are
able to do this and why we're able to

3282
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:47,260
able to do this and why we're able to
 

3283
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:50,280
able to do this and why we're able to
read dogs is it something just simple

3284
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:50,290
read dogs is it something just simple
 

3285
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:52,260
read dogs is it something just simple
like they're they have the right facial

3286
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:52,270
like they're they have the right facial
 

3287
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:54,570
like they're they have the right facial
muscles or is it something some drive

3288
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:54,580
muscles or is it something some drive
 

3289
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:57,390
muscles or is it something some drive
that allows them to learn this so I

3290
01:14:57,390 --> 01:14:57,400
that allows them to learn this so I
 

3291
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,130
that allows them to learn this so I
think before I wrote my book I would

3292
01:14:59,130 --> 01:14:59,140
think before I wrote my book I would
 

3293
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:02,030
think before I wrote my book I would
have answered this question differently

3294
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:02,040
have answered this question differently
 

3295
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,940
have answered this question differently
but now here's what I would say I think

3296
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:04,950
but now here's what I would say I think
 

3297
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:08,190
but now here's what I would say I think
what you know many creatures on this

3298
01:15:08,190 --> 01:15:08,200
what you know many creatures on this
 

3299
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:13,800
what you know many creatures on this
planet have effect right and we can

3300
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:13,810
planet have effect right and we can
 

3301
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:15,420
planet have effect right and we can
debate about whether you know I just

3302
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:15,430
debate about whether you know I just
 

3303
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:16,710
debate about whether you know I just
came across a paper the other day about

3304
01:15:16,710 --> 01:15:16,720
came across a paper the other day about
 

3305
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:19,260
came across a paper the other day about
whether fly you know just your Safa I

3306
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:19,270
whether fly you know just your Safa I
 

3307
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:21,420
whether fly you know just your Safa I
have have effect and you know it's I

3308
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:21,430
have have effect and you know it's I
 

3309
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:22,500
have have effect and you know it's I
mean it's actually really interesting

3310
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:22,510
mean it's actually really interesting
 

3311
01:15:22,510 --> 01:15:24,180
mean it's actually really interesting
question they certainly they have

3312
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:24,190
question they certainly they have
 

3313
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:26,390
question they certainly they have
something like opioids and they you know

3314
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:26,400
something like opioids and they you know
 

3315
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:30,260
something like opioids and they you know
so it's consistory question but dogs

3316
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:30,270
so it's consistory question but dogs
 

3317
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:33,870
so it's consistory question but dogs
dogs are really interesting because they

3318
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:33,880
dogs are really interesting because they
 

3319
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:37,980
dogs are really interesting because they
do seem to have some capacities that

3320
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:37,990
do seem to have some capacities that
 

3321
01:15:37,990 --> 01:15:41,670
do seem to have some capacities that
only that you only see in in great apes

3322
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:41,680
only that you only see in in great apes
 

3323
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:45,330
only that you only see in in great apes
and they may have capacities that great

3324
01:15:45,330 --> 01:15:45,340
and they may have capacities that great
 

3325
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:48,780
and they may have capacities that great
apes even other than us don't have and I

3326
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:48,790
apes even other than us don't have and I
 

3327
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:49,890
apes even other than us don't have and I
mean so they certainly have some

3328
01:15:49,890 --> 01:15:49,900
mean so they certainly have some
 

3329
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:51,870
mean so they certainly have some
capacities we don't have either but but

3330
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:51,880
capacities we don't have either but but
 

3331
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:52,590
capacities we don't have either but but
here's my point

3332
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:52,600
here's my point
 

3333
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:56,190
here's my point
we actually bred them we bred these

3334
01:15:56,190 --> 01:15:56,200
we actually bred them we bred these
 

3335
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:59,010
we actually bred them we bred these
animals we selected them basically it's

3336
01:15:59,010 --> 01:15:59,020
animals we selected them basically it's
 

3337
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:01,650
animals we selected them basically it's
not natural selection it's it's you know

3338
01:16:01,650 --> 01:16:01,660
not natural selection it's it's you know
 

3339
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:04,560
not natural selection it's it's you know
artificial selection and we selected

3340
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:04,570
artificial selection and we selected
 

3341
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:06,540
artificial selection and we selected
them for a couple of things right if you

3342
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:06,550
them for a couple of things right if you
 

3343
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:08,240
them for a couple of things right if you
look at the experiments on breeding

3344
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:08,250
look at the experiments on breeding
 

3345
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:10,920
look at the experiments on breeding
taking a fox you know taking foxes and

3346
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:10,930
taking a fox you know taking foxes and
 

3347
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:12,150
taking a fox you know taking foxes and
breeding them into what looked like

3348
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:12,160
breeding them into what looked like
 

3349
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:14,400
breeding them into what looked like
little dog like animals it's interesting

3350
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:14,410
little dog like animals it's interesting
 

3351
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:16,350
little dog like animals it's interesting
what they can do and one of the things

3352
01:16:16,350 --> 01:16:16,360
what they can do and one of the things
 

3353
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,250
what they can do and one of the things
they can do is they can move their

3354
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:17,260
they can do is they can move their
 

3355
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:19,680
they can do is they can move their
facial muscles and in in in a lot of

3356
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:19,690
facial muscles and in in in a lot of
 

3357
01:16:19,690 --> 01:16:21,510
facial muscles and in in in a lot of
ways that they have a lot more control

3358
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:21,520
ways that they have a lot more control
 

3359
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,610
ways that they have a lot more control
over their facial muscles then you know

3360
01:16:23,610 --> 01:16:23,620
over their facial muscles then you know
 

3361
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:25,050
over their facial muscles then you know
chimpanzees and

3362
01:16:25,050 --> 01:16:25,060
chimpanzees and
 

3363
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:31,520
chimpanzees and
do and and other apes and they also do

3364
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:31,530
do and and other apes and they also do
 

3365
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:34,860
do and and other apes and they also do
they do joint attention really well with

3366
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:34,870
they do joint attention really well with
 

3367
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:38,640
they do joint attention really well with
gays so this is something that really no

3368
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:38,650
gays so this is something that really no
 

3369
01:16:38,650 --> 01:16:40,680
gays so this is something that really no
other animal can do I think other than a

3370
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:40,690
other animal can do I think other than a
 

3371
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:43,800
other animal can do I think other than a
dog other and humans and that is they

3372
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:43,810
dog other and humans and that is they
 

3373
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:48,570
dog other and humans and that is they
can they they meet your gaze and they

3374
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:48,580
can they they meet your gaze and they
 

3375
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:51,810
can they they meet your gaze and they
use gaze for reference so you know

3376
01:16:51,810 --> 01:16:51,820
use gaze for reference so you know
 

3377
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:53,010
use gaze for reference so you know
they'll look at something and they'll

3378
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:53,020
they'll look at something and they'll
 

3379
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:54,660
they'll look at something and they'll
look back at you and you you know that's

3380
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:54,670
look back at you and you you know that's
 

3381
01:16:54,670 --> 01:16:55,830
look back at you and you you know that's
actually partly that's how we

3382
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:55,840
actually partly that's how we
 

3383
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,470
actually partly that's how we
communicate with each other chimpanzees

3384
01:16:58,470 --> 01:16:58,480
communicate with each other chimpanzees
 

3385
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:01,230
communicate with each other chimpanzees
lose that ability after about ten or

3386
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:01,240
lose that ability after about ten or
 

3387
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,960
lose that ability after about ten or
eleven months a year overall of age but

3388
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:03,970
eleven months a year overall of age but
 

3389
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:06,680
eleven months a year overall of age but
but dogs continually do it and actually

3390
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:06,690
but dogs continually do it and actually
 

3391
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:10,650
but dogs continually do it and actually
joint attention shared gaze is how we

3392
01:17:10,650 --> 01:17:10,660
joint attention shared gaze is how we
 

3393
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:12,630
joint attention shared gaze is how we
communicate with our infants also that's

3394
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:12,640
communicate with our infants also that's
 

3395
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,310
communicate with our infants also that's
actually partly how we teach infants

3396
01:17:14,310 --> 01:17:14,320
actually partly how we teach infants
 

3397
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,140
actually partly how we teach infants
about what's important in the world is

3398
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:16,150
about what's important in the world is
 

3399
01:17:16,150 --> 01:17:19,380
about what's important in the world is
with gaze so I think that dogs may

3400
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:19,390
with gaze so I think that dogs may
 

3401
01:17:19,390 --> 01:17:21,900
with gaze so I think that dogs may
actually have some capacities probably

3402
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:21,910
actually have some capacities probably
 

3403
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:25,440
actually have some capacities probably
because we bred them to have those but

3404
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:25,450
because we bred them to have those but
 

3405
01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:28,740
because we bred them to have those but
we selected the animals that you know

3406
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:28,750
we selected the animals that you know
 

3407
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:31,020
we selected the animals that you know
and bred them to have those capacities

3408
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:31,030
and bred them to have those capacities
 

3409
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:33,540
and bred them to have those capacities
that's very interesting again awesome

3410
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:33,550
that's very interesting again awesome
 

3411
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:35,490
that's very interesting again awesome
well with that let's give these a big

3412
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:35,500
well with that let's give these a big
 

3413
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:38,310
well with that let's give these a big
hand thank you so much
