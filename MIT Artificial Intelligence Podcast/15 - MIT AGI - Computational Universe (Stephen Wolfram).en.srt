00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:50,970
answering and so at Marvin and so I was
 

81
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,630
answering and so at Marvin and so I was
going to show Marvin you know Wolfram

82

that's fine whatever said no Marvin this

86
00:01:59,630 --> 00:01:59,640
that's fine whatever said no Marvin this
 

87
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,340
that's fine whatever said no Marvin this
time it actually works

88
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:01,350

you can try real questions this is

90
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,079
you can try real questions this is
 

91
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,840
you can try real questions this is
actually something useful this is not

92
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:05,850
actually something useful this is not
 

93
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,029
actually something useful this is not
just a toy and it was kind of

94
00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:08,039
just a toy and it was kind of
 

95
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,710
just a toy and it was kind of
interesting to see it took took about

96
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:09,720
interesting to see it took took about
 

97
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,360
interesting to see it took took about
five minutes for Marvin to realize that

98
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,370
five minutes for Marvin to realize that
 

99
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,940

this was finally a

100
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:12,950
this was finally a

00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:14,150
to an answering system that could
 

103
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,490
to an answering system that could
actually answer questions that were

104
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:15,500
actually answer questions that were
 

105
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,119
actually answer questions that were
useful to people and so one question is

106
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:19,129
useful to people and so one question is
 

107
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:21,309
useful to people and so one question is
how did we how do we achieve that so you

108
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:21,319
how did we how do we achieve that so you
 

109
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,780
how did we how do we achieve that so you
know you go to Wolf's malphur and you

110
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:22,790
know you go to Wolf's malphur and you
 

111
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,880
know you go to Wolf's malphur and you
can ask it I mean it's I don't know what

112
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:24,890
can ask it I mean it's I don't know what
 

113
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,620
can ask it I mean it's I don't know what
we can ask it I don't know what's the

going to figure out that we mean

124
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440
going to figure out that we mean
 

125

is number of students at MIT divided by
 

133
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,610
is number of students at MIT divided by
population of Cambridge see if it can

134
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:51,620
population of Cambridge see if it can
 

135
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:57,610
population of Cambridge see if it can
figure that out and okay it's kind of

136
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:57,620
figure that out and okay it's kind of
 

137
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,559
figure that out and okay it's kind of
interesting right oh no that's / ah

138
00:02:59,559 --> 00:02:59,569

that's interesting a guest that we were

140
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,090
that's interesting a guest that we were
 

141
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,940
that's interesting a guest that we were
talking about Cambridge University as

142
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:03,950
talking about Cambridge University as
 

143
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,100
talking about Cambridge University as
the as the denominator there so it says

144
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,110
the as the denominator there so it says
 

145
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,650
the as the denominator there so it says
the number of students at MIT divided by

146
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:08,660
the number of students at MIT divided by
 

147
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,819
the number of students at MIT divided by
the number of students at Cambridge

148
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:09,829
the number of students at Cambridge
 

149
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:10,990
the number of students at Cambridge
University that's interesting I'm

150
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,000
University that's interesting I'm
 

151
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,250
University that's interesting I'm
actually surprised let's see what

152
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:12,260
actually surprised let's see what
 

153
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,610
actually surprised let's see what
happens if I say Cambridge MA there now

154
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:15,620
happens if I say Cambridge MA there now
 

155
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,069
happens if I say Cambridge MA there now
as it probably fail horribly no that's

156
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:18,079
as it probably fail horribly no that's
 

157
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:21,789
as it probably fail horribly no that's
that's good okay so no that's

158
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:21,799
that's good okay so no that's
 

159
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:23,920
that's good okay so no that's
interesting that's a plot as a function

160
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:23,930
interesting that's a plot as a function
 

161
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:28,090
interesting that's a plot as a function
of time of the fraction of the of okay

162
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:28,100
of time of the fraction of the of okay
 

163
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:35,020
of time of the fraction of the of okay
so anyway so I'm glad it works the so

164
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,030
so anyway so I'm glad it works the so
 

165
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,840
so anyway so I'm glad it works the so
one one question is how did we manage to

166
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:37,850
one one question is how did we manage to
 

167
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,759
one one question is how did we manage to
get so that many things have to work in

168
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:39,769
get so that many things have to work in
 

169
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:42,759
get so that many things have to work in
order to get stuff like this to work you

170
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:42,769
order to get stuff like this to work you
 

171
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:43,930
order to get stuff like this to work you
have to be able to understand the

172
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:43,940
have to be able to understand the
 

173
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,520
have to be able to understand the
natural language you have to have that

174
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:45,530
natural language you have to have that
 

175
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,930
natural language you have to have that
data sources you have to be able to

176
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:46,940
data sources you have to be able to
 

177
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,170
data sources you have to be able to
compute things from the data and so on

178
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:49,180
compute things from the data and so on
 

179
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,490
compute things from the data and so on
one of the things that was a surprise to

180
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:51,500
one of the things that was a surprise to
 

181
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,259
one of the things that was a surprise to
me was in terms of natural language

182
00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:53,269
me was in terms of natural language
 

183
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:56,680
me was in terms of natural language
understanding was the critical thing

184
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:56,690
understanding was the critical thing
 

185
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,690
understanding was the critical thing
turned out to be just knowing a lot of

186
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:58,700
turned out to be just knowing a lot of
 

187
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,539
turned out to be just knowing a lot of
stuff the actual pausing of the natural

188
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:01,549
stuff the actual pausing of the natural
 

189
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:04,300
stuff the actual pausing of the natural
language is kind of I think it's kind of

190
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:04,310
language is kind of I think it's kind of
 

191
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,890
language is kind of I think it's kind of
clever and we use a bunch of ideas that

192
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:05,900
clever and we use a bunch of ideas that
 

193
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,930
clever and we use a bunch of ideas that
came from my new kind of science project

194
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:07,940
came from my new kind of science project
 

195
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,210
came from my new kind of science project
and so on but I think the most important

196
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:10,220
and so on but I think the most important
 

197
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,470
and so on but I think the most important
thing is just knowing a lot of stuff

198
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:11,480
thing is just knowing a lot of stuff
 

199
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,099
thing is just knowing a lot of stuff
about the world is is really important

200
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:15,109
about the world is is really important
 

201
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:17,349
about the world is is really important
to actually being able to to understand

202
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:17,359
to actually being able to to understand
 

203
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,569
to actually being able to to understand
natural language in a useful situation I

204
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:19,579
natural language in a useful situation I
 

205
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:23,570
natural language in a useful situation I
think the other thing is having

206
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:23,580
think the other thing is having
 

207
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,820
think the other thing is having
actually having access to lots of data

208
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:25,830
actually having access to lots of data
 

209
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,619
actually having access to lots of data
let me show you a typical example here

210
00:04:27,619 --> 00:04:27,629
let me show you a typical example here
 

211
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:30,379
let me show you a typical example here
of what is needed so I asked about the

212
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:30,389
of what is needed so I asked about the
 

213
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:33,110
of what is needed so I asked about the
ISS and hopefully it'll wake up and tell

214
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,120
ISS and hopefully it'll wake up and tell
 

215
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,640
ISS and hopefully it'll wake up and tell
us something here come on what's going

216
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:34,650
us something here come on what's going
 

217
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,279
us something here come on what's going
on here there we go okay so it figured

218
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:37,289
on here there we go okay so it figured
 

219
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:38,869
on here there we go okay so it figured
out that we probably are talking about a

220
00:04:38,869 --> 00:04:38,879
out that we probably are talking about a
 

221
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,179
out that we probably are talking about a
spacecraft not a file format and now

222
00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:41,189
spacecraft not a file format and now
 

223
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:42,439
spacecraft not a file format and now
it's going to give us a plot that shows

224
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:42,449
it's going to give us a plot that shows
 

225
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:46,580
it's going to give us a plot that shows
us where the ISS is right now so to make

226
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:46,590
us where the ISS is right now so to make
 

227
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,439
us where the ISS is right now so to make
this work we obviously have to have some

228
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:48,449
this work we obviously have to have some
 

229
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:51,619
this work we obviously have to have some
feed of you know radar tracking data

230
00:04:51,619 --> 00:04:51,629
feed of you know radar tracking data
 

231
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:53,450
feed of you know radar tracking data
about satellites and so on which we have

232
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:53,460
about satellites and so on which we have
 

233
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,459
about satellites and so on which we have
for every satellite that's that's out

234
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:55,469
for every satellite that's that's out
 

235
00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:58,100
for every satellite that's that's out
there but then that's not good enough to

236
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,110
there but then that's not good enough to
 

237
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,170
there but then that's not good enough to
just have that feed then you also have

238
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:00,180
just have that feed then you also have
 

239
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,600
just have that feed then you also have
to be able to do celestial mechanics to

240
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:02,610
to be able to do celestial mechanics to
 

241
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,059
to be able to do celestial mechanics to
work out well where is the ISS actually

242
00:05:05,059 --> 00:05:05,069
work out well where is the ISS actually
 

243
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:06,740
work out well where is the ISS actually
right now based on the orbital elements

244
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:06,750
right now based on the orbital elements
 

245
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,600
right now based on the orbital elements
that have been deduced from radar and

246
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:08,610
that have been deduced from radar and
 

247
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,879
that have been deduced from radar and
then if we want to know things like okay

248
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:10,889
then if we want to know things like okay
 

249
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:12,830
then if we want to know things like okay
when is it going to it's not currently

250
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:12,840
when is it going to it's not currently
 

251
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,719
when is it going to it's not currently
visible from Boston Massachusetts it

252
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:14,729
visible from Boston Massachusetts it
 

253
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:19,059
visible from Boston Massachusetts it
will next rise at 7:30 6:00 p.m. on

254
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:19,069
will next rise at 7:30 6:00 p.m. on
 

255
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:23,659
will next rise at 7:30 6:00 p.m. on
Monday on today so you know this

256
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:23,669
Monday on today so you know this
 

257
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:27,080
Monday on today so you know this
requires a mixture of data about what's

258
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,090
requires a mixture of data about what's
 

259
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,939
requires a mixture of data about what's
going on in the world together with

260
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:28,949
going on in the world together with
 

261
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:31,129
going on in the world together with
models about how the world is supposed

262
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:31,139
models about how the world is supposed
 

263
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,200
models about how the world is supposed
to work being able to predict things and

264
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,210
to work being able to predict things and
 

265
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,850
to work being able to predict things and
so on and I think another thing that

266
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:34,860
so on and I think another thing that
 

267
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,689
so on and I think another thing that
kind of realized about about AI and so

268
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:38,699
kind of realized about about AI and so
 

269
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,379
kind of realized about about AI and so
on from the wolfman alpha effort has

270
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:42,389
on from the wolfman alpha effort has
 

271
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:46,219
on from the wolfman alpha effort has
been that you know one of the earlier

272
00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:46,229
been that you know one of the earlier
 

273
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:49,490
been that you know one of the earlier
ideas for how one would achieve AI was

274
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:49,500
ideas for how one would achieve AI was
 

275
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,170
ideas for how one would achieve AI was
let's make it work kind of like brains

276
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:51,180
let's make it work kind of like brains
 

277
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,579
let's make it work kind of like brains
do and let's make it figure stuff out

278
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:52,589
do and let's make it figure stuff out
 

279
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:54,589
do and let's make it figure stuff out
and so if it has to do physics let's

280
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:54,599
and so if it has to do physics let's
 

281
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:56,680
and so if it has to do physics let's
have it do physics by pure reasoning

282
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:56,690
have it do physics by pure reasoning
 

283
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,709
have it do physics by pure reasoning
like you know people at least used to do

284
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:00,719
like you know people at least used to do
 

285
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:03,170
like you know people at least used to do
physics but in the last 300 years we've

286
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:03,180
physics but in the last 300 years we've
 

287
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,820
physics but in the last 300 years we've
had a different way to do physics that

288
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:04,830
had a different way to do physics that
 

289
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,170
had a different way to do physics that
wasn't sort of based on natural

290
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:06,180
wasn't sort of based on natural
 

291
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,240
wasn't sort of based on natural
philosophy it was instead based on

292
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,250
philosophy it was instead based on
 

293
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,700
philosophy it was instead based on
things like mathematics and so one of

294
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:10,710
things like mathematics and so one of
 

295
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,589
things like mathematics and so one of
the things that we were doing in in

296
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:12,599
the things that we were doing in in
 

297
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:14,570
the things that we were doing in in
Wolfman alpha was to kind of cheat

298
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:14,580
Wolfman alpha was to kind of cheat
 

299
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,519
Wolfman alpha was to kind of cheat
relative to what had been done in

300
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:16,529
relative to what had been done in
 

301
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:19,040
relative to what had been done in
previous AI systems which was instead of

302
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,050
previous AI systems which was instead of
 

303
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,749
previous AI systems which was instead of
using kind of reasoning type methods

304
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:20,759
using kind of reasoning type methods
 

305
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,159
using kind of reasoning type methods
we're just saying okay we want to

306
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:22,169
we're just saying okay we want to
 

307
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:23,869
we're just saying okay we want to
compute where the ISS is going to be

308
00:06:23,869 --> 00:06:23,879
compute where the ISS is going to be
 

309
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,430
compute where the ISS is going to be
well we've got a bunch of equations of

310
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,440
well we've got a bunch of equations of
 

311
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,959
well we've got a bunch of equations of
motion that corresponds to differential

312
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:26,969
motion that corresponds to differential
 

313
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,430
motion that corresponds to differential
equations we're just going to solve the

314
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:28,440
equations we're just going to solve the
 

315
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,230
equations we're just going to solve the
equations of motion and get an answer

316
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
equations of motion and get an answer
 

317

00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:32,430
that's kind of leveraging the last 300
 

319
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,839
that's kind of leveraging the last 300
years or so of

00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:33,849
years or so of

00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:37,719
rather than trying to make use of kind
 

325
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:40,199
rather than trying to make use of kind
of human reasoning ideas and I might

00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:40,209
of human reasoning ideas and I might
 

327
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:42,809
of human reasoning ideas and I might
might say that in terms of the the

00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:42,819
might say that in terms of the the
 

329
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,019
might say that in terms of the the
history of the wolf malphur project when

00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:46,029
history of the wolf malphur project when

I was a kid a disgustingly a long time

332
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:48,550
I was a kid a disgustingly a long time
 

333
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,269
I was a kid a disgustingly a long time
ago I was interested in AI kinds of

334
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:51,279
ago I was interested in AI kinds of
 

335
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:54,029
ago I was interested in AI kinds of
things and I in fact I was kind of upset

336
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:54,039
things and I in fact I was kind of upset
 

337
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,829
things and I in fact I was kind of upset
recently to find a bunch of stuff I did

338
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:55,839
recently to find a bunch of stuff I did
 

339
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,359
recently to find a bunch of stuff I did
when I was 12 years old kind of trying

340
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:57,369
when I was 12 years old kind of trying
 

341
00:06:57,369 --> 00:06:59,489
when I was 12 years old kind of trying
to assemble a pre version of Wolfram

342
00:06:59,489 --> 00:06:59,499
to assemble a pre version of Wolfram
 

343
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:01,379
to assemble a pre version of Wolfram
Alpha way back before it was

344
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:01,389
Alpha way back before it was
 

345
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:02,999
Alpha way back before it was
technologically possible but it's also a

346
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:03,009
technologically possible but it's also a
 

347
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:04,889
technologically possible but it's also a
reminder that one just does the same

348
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:04,899
reminder that one just does the same
 

349
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:07,589

some level um but what happened was when

352
00:07:11,489 --> 00:07:11,499
some level um but what happened was when
 

353
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:16,079
some level um but what happened was when
when I am I started off working mainly

354
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:16,089
when I am I started off working mainly
 

355
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:18,449
when I am I started off working mainly
in physics and then I got involved in

356
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:18,459
in physics and then I got involved in
 

357
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:20,339
in physics and then I got involved in
building computer systems to do things

358
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:20,349
building computer systems to do things
 

359
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:21,959
building computer systems to do things
like mathematical computation and so on

360
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:21,969
like mathematical computation and so on
 

361
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:25,169
like mathematical computation and so on
and I then sort of got interested in

362
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:25,179
and I then sort of got interested in
 

363
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:27,779
and I then sort of got interested in
okay so can we generalize this stuff and

364
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:27,789
okay so can we generalize this stuff and
 

365
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:30,600
okay so can we generalize this stuff and
can we can we really make systems that

366
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:30,610
can we can we really make systems that
 

367
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,100
can we can we really make systems that
can answer sort of arbitrary questions

368
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,110
can answer sort of arbitrary questions
 

369
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,249
can answer sort of arbitrary questions
about the world and for example sort of

370
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:35,259
about the world and for example sort of
 

371
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:37,769
about the world and for example sort of
the the the the promise would be if

372
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:37,779
the the the the promise would be if
 

373
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:40,619
the the the the promise would be if
there's something that is systematically

374
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:40,629
there's something that is systematically
 

375
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:42,209
there's something that is systematically
known in our civilization make it

376
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:42,219
known in our civilization make it
 

377
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:44,159
known in our civilization make it
automatic to answer questions on the

378
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:44,169
automatic to answer questions on the
 

379
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:45,809
automatic to answer questions on the
basis of that systematic knowledge and

380
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:45,819
basis of that systematic knowledge and
 

381
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:49,230
basis of that systematic knowledge and
back in the in around late 1970s early

382
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:49,240
back in the in around late 1970s early
 

383
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,269
back in the in around late 1970s early
1980s my conclusion was if you want to

384
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:51,279
1980s my conclusion was if you want to
 

385
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,679
1980s my conclusion was if you want to
do something like that the only

386
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:52,689
do something like that the only
 

387
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,569
do something like that the only
realistic path to being able to do it

388
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:54,579
realistic path to being able to do it
 

389
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:56,549
realistic path to being able to do it
was to build something much like a brain

390
00:07:56,549 --> 00:07:56,559
was to build something much like a brain
 

391
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,859
was to build something much like a brain
and so I got interested in neural nets

392
00:07:58,859 --> 00:07:58,869
and so I got interested in neural nets
 

393
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:00,149
and so I got interested in neural nets
and I tried to do things with neural

394
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:00,159
and I tried to do things with neural
 

395
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:02,489
and I tried to do things with neural
nets back in 1980 and nothing very

396
00:08:02,489 --> 00:08:02,499
nets back in 1980 and nothing very
 

397
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:04,230
nets back in 1980 and nothing very
interesting happened well I couldn't get

398
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240
interesting happened well I couldn't get
 

399
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,819
interesting happened well I couldn't get
him to do anything very interesting and

400
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:05,829
him to do anything very interesting and
 

401
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:09,449
him to do anything very interesting and
that um so I kind of had the idea that

402
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:09,459
that um so I kind of had the idea that
 

403
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:11,459
that um so I kind of had the idea that
that the only way to get the kind of

404
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:11,469
that the only way to get the kind of
 

405
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:13,319
that the only way to get the kind of
thing that now exists in alpha for

406
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:13,329
thing that now exists in alpha for
 

407
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:16,199
thing that now exists in alpha for
example was to build a brain like thing

408
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:16,209
example was to build a brain like thing
 

409
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:19,169
example was to build a brain like thing
and then many years later for reasons I

410
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:19,179
and then many years later for reasons I
 

411
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:21,540
and then many years later for reasons I
can explain I kind of came back to this

412
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:21,550
can explain I kind of came back to this
 

413
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,609
can explain I kind of came back to this
and realized actually it wasn't true

414
00:08:23,609 --> 00:08:23,619
and realized actually it wasn't true
 

415
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:24,779
and realized actually it wasn't true
that you had to build a brain like

416
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:24,789
that you had to build a brain like
 

417
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:26,639
that you had to build a brain like
things sort of mere computation was

418
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:26,649
things sort of mere computation was
 

419
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:28,980
things sort of mere computation was
sufficient and that was kind of what got

420
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:28,990
sufficient and that was kind of what got
 

421
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,449
sufficient and that was kind of what got
me started actually trying to build

422
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:30,459
me started actually trying to build
 

423
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:32,279
me started actually trying to build
Wolfram Alpha when we started building

424
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:32,289
Wolfram Alpha when we started building
 

425
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,350
Wolfram Alpha when we started building
wolf malphur one of these I did was go

426
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:34,360
wolf malphur one of these I did was go
 

427
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,509
wolf malphur one of these I did was go
to a sort of a field trip to a big

428
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:36,519
to a sort of a field trip to a big
 

429
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:38,610
to a sort of a field trip to a big
reference library and you know you see

430
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:38,620
reference library and you know you see
 

431
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,469
reference library and you know you see
all these shelves of books and so on and

432
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:40,479
all these shelves of books and so on and
 

433
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,149
all these shelves of books and so on and
the question is can we take all of this

434
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:42,159
the question is can we take all of this
 

435
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,679
the question is can we take all of this
knowledge that exists in all of these

436
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:43,689
knowledge that exists in all of these
 

437
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,410
knowledge that exists in all of these
books and actually automate being able

439
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,630
books and actually automate being able
to answer questions on the base

Javad and I think we've pretty much done

442
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:49,620
Javad and I think we've pretty much done
 

443
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,530
Javad and I think we've pretty much done
that for that at least the books you

444
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:51,540
that for that at least the books you
 

445
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,200
that for that at least the books you
find in a typical reference library so

446
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,210
find in a typical reference library so
 

447
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,750
find in a typical reference library so
that was it looked kind of daunting at

448
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:56,760
that was it looked kind of daunting at
 

449
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,190
that was it looked kind of daunting at
the beginning because it's this there's

the beginning because it's this there's
 

451
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,080
the beginning because it's this there's
a lot of knowledge and information out

a lot of knowledge and information out
 

453
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,970
a lot of knowledge and information out
there but actually it turns out there

of the worth mouthful project was that

462
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:09,480
of the worth mouthful project was that
 

463
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,420
of the worth mouthful project was that
we didn't really you know I've been

00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,050
theories of the world one of my
principles in building Wolfram Alpha was

00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:18,060
principles in building Wolfram Alpha was
 

473
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,790
principles in building Wolfram Alpha was
not to start from a grand theory of the

00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,200
then try and build down into all these
different domains but instead to work up

there were common themes in these
 

501
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,820
there were common themes in these
domains that we could then build into

domains that we could then build into
 

503
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,310
domains that we could then build into
frameworks and then sort of construct

504
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:49,320
frameworks and then sort of construct
 

505
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,810
frameworks and then sort of construct
the whole system on the basis of that

506
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:50,820
the whole system on the basis of that
 

507
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,280
the whole system on the basis of that
and that's kind of that's kind of how

508
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:52,290
and that's kind of that's kind of how
 

509
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,810
and that's kind of that's kind of how
its worked and I can talk about some of

510
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:53,820
its worked and I can talk about some of
 

511
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,010
its worked and I can talk about some of
the actual frameworks that we end up

512
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:55,020
the actual frameworks that we end up
 

513
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,150
the actual frameworks that we end up
using and so on but maybe I should

514
00:09:59,150 --> 00:09:59,160
using and so on but maybe I should
 

515
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,960
using and so on but maybe I should
explain a little bit more so so one

516
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:02,970
explain a little bit more so so one
 

517
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,340
explain a little bit more so so one
question is how does how does Wolf's

518
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:04,350
question is how does how does Wolf's
 

519
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,470
question is how does how does Wolf's
mouth actually sort of work inside and

520
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,480
mouth actually sort of work inside and
 

521
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,410
mouth actually sort of work inside and
the answer is it's a big program it's

522
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:09,420
the answer is it's a big program it's
 

523
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,170
the answer is it's a big program it's
about it's the core system is about 15

524
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:12,180
about it's the core system is about 15
 

525
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,050
about it's the core system is about 15
million lines of Wolfram language code

526
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:14,060
million lines of Wolfram language code
 

527
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,150
million lines of Wolfram language code
and it's some number of terabytes of raw

528
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:17,160
and it's some number of terabytes of raw
 

529
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:23,270
and it's some number of terabytes of raw
data and so the the way the thing that

530
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:23,280
data and so the the way the thing that
 

531
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,130
data and so the the way the thing that
sort of made building wolf now for

532
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:25,140
sort of made building wolf now for
 

533
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,230
sort of made building wolf now for
possible was this language wolf and

534
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:27,240
possible was this language wolf and
 

535
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,440
possible was this language wolf and

maybe I should show you some things
 

543
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,230
maybe I should show you some things
about both language and and you know

the basics work the let's let's start

554
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:55,410
the basics work the let's let's start
 

555
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,920
the basics work the let's let's start
off with something like let's make a

556
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:57,930
off with something like let's make a
 

557
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,369
off with something like let's make a
random graph and let's say we have

558
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:01,379
random graph and let's say we have
 

559
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:03,049
random graph and let's say we have
a random graph with two hundred nodes

560
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:03,059
a random graph with two hundred nodes
 

561
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:04,999
a random graph with two hundred nodes
400 vertices okay so there's a random

562
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:05,009
400 vertices okay so there's a random
 

563
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:07,069
400 vertices okay so there's a random
graph a first important thing about

564
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:07,079
graph a first important thing about
 

565
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:08,629
graph a first important thing about
wolfing language is it's a symbolic

566
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:08,639
wolfing language is it's a symbolic
 

567
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,249
wolfing language is it's a symbolic
language so I can just pick up this

568
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:10,259
language so I can just pick up this
 

569
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:12,469
language so I can just pick up this
graph and I could say you know I don't

570
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:12,479
graph and I could say you know I don't
 

571
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:14,629
graph and I could say you know I don't
do some analysis of this graph that

572
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:14,639
do some analysis of this graph that
 

573
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,669
do some analysis of this graph that
graph is just a symbolic thing that I

574
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:16,679
graph is just a symbolic thing that I
 

575
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:19,519
graph is just a symbolic thing that I
can just do computations on oh I could

576
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:19,529
can just do computations on oh I could
 

577
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:22,789
can just do computations on oh I could
say let's let's get a another good thing

578
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:22,799
say let's let's get a another good thing
 

579
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,909
say let's let's get a another good thing
to always do is get a current image see

580
00:11:25,909 --> 00:11:25,919
to always do is get a current image see
 

581
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,359
to always do is get a current image see
there we go and now I could go and say

582
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:29,369
there we go and now I could go and say
 

583
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:33,049
there we go and now I could go and say
something like let's let's do some basic

584
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:33,059
something like let's let's do some basic
 

585
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,999
something like let's let's do some basic
thing let's say let's edgy detect that

586
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:35,009
thing let's say let's edgy detect that
 

587
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:38,359
thing let's say let's edgy detect that
image again this this image is just a a

588
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:38,369
image again this this image is just a a
 

589
00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:40,519
image again this this image is just a a
thing that we can manipulate we could

590
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:40,529
thing that we can manipulate we could
 

591
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:44,599
thing that we can manipulate we could
take the image we could make it I don't

592
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:44,609
take the image we could make it I don't
 

593
00:11:44,609 --> 00:11:45,919
take the image we could make it I don't
know we could take the image and

594
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:45,929
know we could take the image and
 

595
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:48,019
know we could take the image and
partition it little pieces do

596
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:48,029
partition it little pieces do
 

597
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:50,569
partition it little pieces do
computations on that I don't know simple

598
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:50,579
computations on that I don't know simple
 

599
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:53,929
computations on that I don't know simple
let's do let's just say sort each row of

600
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:53,939
let's do let's just say sort each row of
 

601
00:11:53,939 --> 00:11:56,299
let's do let's just say sort each row of
the image assemble the image again

602
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:56,309
the image assemble the image again
 

603
00:11:56,309 --> 00:12:02,299
the image assemble the image again
whoops assemble that image again we'll

604
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:02,309
whoops assemble that image again we'll
 

605
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:04,669
whoops assemble that image again we'll
get some some mixed up picture there if

606
00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:04,679
get some some mixed up picture there if
 

607
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:06,289
get some some mixed up picture there if
I wanted to I could for example let's

608
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:06,299
I wanted to I could for example let's
 

609
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:07,819
I wanted to I could for example let's
say let's make that the current image

610
00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:07,829
say let's make that the current image
 

611
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:10,999
say let's make that the current image
and let's say make that dynamic now I

612
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:11,009
and let's say make that dynamic now I
 

613
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:13,099
and let's say make that dynamic now I
can be just running that code hopefully

614
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:13,109
can be just running that code hopefully
 

615
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:16,669
can be just running that code hopefully
and little loop and there we can make

616
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:16,679
and little loop and there we can make
 

617
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:20,719
and little loop and there we can make
that work so the you know one one

618
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:20,729
that work so the you know one one
 

619
00:12:20,729 --> 00:12:23,749
that work so the you know one one
general point here is there's you know

620
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:23,759
general point here is there's you know
 

621
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,269
general point here is there's you know
this is just an image for us is just a

622
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:26,279
this is just an image for us is just a
 

623
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,159
this is just an image for us is just a
piece of data like anything else if we

624
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:28,169
piece of data like anything else if we
 

625
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:30,379
piece of data like anything else if we
just have a variable a thing called X it

626
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:30,389
just have a variable a thing called X it
 

627
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:32,329
just have a variable a thing called X it
just says okay that's X I don't need to

628
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:32,339
just says okay that's X I don't need to
 

629
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:34,039
just says okay that's X I don't need to
know particular value it's just a

630
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:34,049
know particular value it's just a
 

631
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:37,579
know particular value it's just a
symbolic thing the corresponds to that's

632
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:37,589
symbolic thing the corresponds to that's
 

633
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:40,779
symbolic thing the corresponds to that's
a thing called X now you know what gets

634
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:40,789
a thing called X now you know what gets
 

635
00:12:40,789 --> 00:12:43,699
a thing called X now you know what gets
interesting when you have a symbolic

636
00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:43,709
interesting when you have a symbolic
 

637
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:45,739
interesting when you have a symbolic
language and so on is we're interested

638
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:45,749
language and so on is we're interested
 

639
00:12:45,749 --> 00:12:47,479
language and so on is we're interested
in having it represent stuff about the

640
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:47,489
in having it represent stuff about the
 

641
00:12:47,489 --> 00:12:49,999
in having it represent stuff about the
world as well as just abstract kinds of

642
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:50,009
world as well as just abstract kinds of
 

643
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:50,840
world as well as just abstract kinds of
things that many you know I can

644
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:50,850
things that many you know I can
 

645
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,960
things that many you know I can
abstractly say you know find some funky

646
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:53,970
abstractly say you know find some funky
 

647
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:57,289
abstractly say you know find some funky
integral I don't know what you know

648
00:12:57,289 --> 00:12:57,299
integral I don't know what you know
 

649
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:00,889
integral I don't know what you know
that's then representing using symbolic

650
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:00,899
that's then representing using symbolic
 

651
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,019
that's then representing using symbolic
variables to represent algebraic kinds

652
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:03,029
variables to represent algebraic kinds
 

653
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:05,449
variables to represent algebraic kinds
of things but I could also just say I

654
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:05,459
of things but I could also just say I
 

655
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,309
of things but I could also just say I
don't know something like Boston and

656
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:07,319
don't know something like Boston and
 

657
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,889
don't know something like Boston and
Boston is another kind of symbolic thing

658
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:09,899
Boston is another kind of symbolic thing
 

659
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:13,340
Boston is another kind of symbolic thing
that has if I say what what is it really

660
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:13,350
that has if I say what what is it really
 

661
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,129
that has if I say what what is it really
inside that's it's the

00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:15,139
inside that's it's the
 

663
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:18,460
inside that's it's the
today a City Boston Massachusetts United

664
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:18,470
today a City Boston Massachusetts United
 

665
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,710

States actually noticed when I type that

666
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:20,720
States actually noticed when I type that
 

667
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,439
States actually noticed when I type that
in I was using natural language to type

668
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:23,449
in I was using natural language to type
 

669
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:25,059
in I was using natural language to type
it in and it gave me a bunch of

670
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:25,069
it in and it gave me a bunch of
 

671
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:27,160
it in and it gave me a bunch of
disambiguation here it said assuming

672
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,170
disambiguation here it said assuming
 

673
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,799
disambiguation here it said assuming
Boston is a city assuming Boston

674
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:29,809
Boston is a city assuming Boston
 

675
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,809
Boston is a city assuming Boston
Massachusetts use Boston New York or

676
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:31,819
Massachusetts use Boston New York or
 

677
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:34,119
Massachusetts use Boston New York or
okay there's let's use let's use Boston

678
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:34,129
okay there's let's use let's use Boston
 

679
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:35,349
okay there's let's use let's use Boston
and the Philippines which I've never

680
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:35,359
and the Philippines which I've never
 

681
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,349
and the Philippines which I've never
heard of but but um let's try using that

682
00:13:38,349 --> 00:13:38,359
heard of but but um let's try using that
 

683
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,749
heard of but but um let's try using that
instead and now if I look at that it'll

684
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:40,759
instead and now if I look at that it'll
 

685
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:43,030
instead and now if I look at that it'll
say it's Boston in some province of the

686
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,040
say it's Boston in some province of the
 

687
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,939
say it's Boston in some province of the
Philippines etc etc now I might ask it

688
00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:45,949
Philippines etc etc now I might ask it
 

689
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:48,309
Philippines etc etc now I might ask it
of that I could say something like

690
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:48,319
of that I could say something like
 

691
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:54,840
of that I could say something like
what's the population of that and it um

692
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:54,850
what's the population of that and it um
 

693
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,759
what's the population of that and it um
okay it's a fairly small place or I

694
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:57,769
okay it's a fairly small place or I
 

695
00:13:57,769 --> 00:13:59,499
okay it's a fairly small place or I
could say for example let me let me do

696
00:13:59,499 --> 00:13:59,509
could say for example let me let me do
 

697
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:02,439
could say for example let me let me do
this let me say a geo list plot from

698
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:02,449
this let me say a geo list plot from
 

699
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:05,579
this let me say a geo list plot from
that Boston

700
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:05,589
that Boston
 

701
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:09,249
that Boston
let's take from that Boston - and now

702
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:09,259
let's take from that Boston - and now
 

703
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:11,109
let's take from that Boston - and now
let's type in Boston again and now let's

704
00:14:11,109 --> 00:14:11,119
let's type in Boston again and now let's
 

705
00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:12,669
let's type in Boston again and now let's
have it used the default meaning of the

706
00:14:12,669 --> 00:14:12,679
have it used the default meaning of the
 

707
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:15,280
have it used the default meaning of the
word of Boston and then let's join those

708
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,290
word of Boston and then let's join those
 

709
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,340
word of Boston and then let's join those
up and now this should plot this should

710
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:18,350
up and now this should plot this should
 

711
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,309
up and now this should plot this should
show me a plot there we go okay so

712
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:21,319
show me a plot there we go okay so
 

713
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,970
show me a plot there we go okay so
there's the path from the Boston that we

714
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:24,980
there's the path from the Boston that we
 

715
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,530
there's the path from the Boston that we
picked in the Philippines to the Boston

716
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:26,540
picked in the Philippines to the Boston
 

717
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,299
picked in the Philippines to the Boston
here oh we could ask you don't know I

718
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:28,309
here oh we could ask you don't know I
 

719
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:30,579
here oh we could ask you don't know I
could just say I could ask it the

720
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:30,589
could just say I could ask it the
 

721
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:31,720
could just say I could ask it the
distance from one to another or

722
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:31,730
distance from one to another or
 

723
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,600
distance from one to another or
something like that so the the one of

724
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:34,610
something like that so the the one of
 

725
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,329
something like that so the the one of
the things here one things we found

726
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:37,339
the things here one things we found
 

727
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:39,069
the things here one things we found
really really useful actually in

728
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:39,079
really really useful actually in
 

729
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,079
really really useful actually in
language was first of all there's a way

730
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:41,089
language was first of all there's a way
 

731
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,759
language was first of all there's a way
of representing stuff about the world

732
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:42,769
of representing stuff about the world
 

733
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:45,519
of representing stuff about the world
like cities for example or let's say I

734
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:45,529
like cities for example or let's say I
 

735
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:47,079
like cities for example or let's say I
want to say let's let's do this let's

736
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:47,089
want to say let's let's do this let's
 

737
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:51,280
want to say let's let's do this let's
say let's do something with cities let's

738
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:51,290
say let's do something with cities let's
 

739
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,039
say let's do something with cities let's
say capital cities in South America okay

740
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:54,049
say capital cities in South America okay
 

741
00:14:54,049 --> 00:14:55,869
say capital cities in South America okay
so notice this is a piece of natural

742
00:14:55,869 --> 00:14:55,879
so notice this is a piece of natural
 

743
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:58,809
so notice this is a piece of natural
language this will get interpreted into

744
00:14:58,809 --> 00:14:58,819
language this will get interpreted into
 

745
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:01,299
language this will get interpreted into
something which is precise symbolic

746
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:01,309
something which is precise symbolic
 

747
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:04,059
something which is precise symbolic
wolfram language code that we can then

748
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:04,069
wolfram language code that we can then
 

749
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,009
wolfram language code that we can then
compute with and that will give us the

750
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:06,019
compute with and that will give us the
 

751
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:07,900
compute with and that will give us the
citizens out the capital cities in South

752
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:07,910
citizens out the capital cities in South
 

753
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,479
citizens out the capital cities in South
America I could for example let's say I

754
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:10,489
America I could for example let's say I
 

755
00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:12,669
America I could for example let's say I
say find shortest to US and I'm going to

756
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:12,679
say find shortest to US and I'm going to
 

757
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:16,840
say find shortest to US and I'm going to
use some some oops no I don't want to do

758
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:16,850
use some some oops no I don't want to do
 

759
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,759
use some some oops no I don't want to do
that what I want to do first is to say

760
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:18,769
that what I want to do first is to say
 

761
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:22,419
that what I want to do first is to say
show me the geo positions of all those

762
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:22,429
show me the geo positions of all those
 

763
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:25,059
show me the geo positions of all those
cities on line 21 there so now it will

764
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:25,069
cities on line 21 there so now it will
 

765
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:26,949
cities on line 21 there so now it will
find the geo positions and now it will

766
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:26,959
find the geo positions and now it will
 

767
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,010
find the geo positions and now it will
say compute the shortest tour

768
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:29,020
say compute the shortest tour
 

769
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,639
say compute the shortest tour
so that's saying there's a 10,000 mile

770
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:31,649
so that's saying there's a 10,000 mile
 

771
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:34,470
so that's saying there's a 10,000 mile
traveling salesman tour around those

772
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,480
traveling salesman tour around those
 

773
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,300
traveling salesman tour around those
cities so I could take those cities were

774
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:36,310
cities so I could take those cities were
 

775
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,240
cities so I could take those cities were
on line 21 and I could say order the

776
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,250
on line 21 and I could say order the
 

777
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,550
on line 21 and I could say order the
cities according to this and then I

778
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:41,560
cities according to this and then I
 

779
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,540
cities according to this and then I
could make another geo list plot of that

780
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:44,550
could make another geo list plot of that
 

781
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:49,170
could make another geo list plot of that
join it up and this should now show us a

782
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:49,180
join it up and this should now show us a
 

783
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,170
join it up and this should now show us a
traveling salesman tour of the of the

784
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:52,180
traveling salesman tour of the of the
 

785
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,170
traveling salesman tour of the of the
capital cities in South America um so

786
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:55,180
capital cities in South America um so
 

787
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,360
capital cities in South America um so
you know it's it's sort of interesting

788
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:57,370
you know it's it's sort of interesting
 

789
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,070
you know it's it's sort of interesting
to see what's involved in making stuff

790
00:15:59,070 --> 00:15:59,080
to see what's involved in making stuff
 

791
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,530
to see what's involved in making stuff
like this work the one of you know my my

792
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:04,540
like this work the one of you know my my
 

793
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,660
like this work the one of you know my my
goal has been to sort of automate as

794
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:06,670
goal has been to sort of automate as
 

795
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,780
goal has been to sort of automate as
much as possible about things that have

796
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:09,790
much as possible about things that have
 

797
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,180
much as possible about things that have
to be computed and that means knowing as

798
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:12,190
to be computed and that means knowing as
 

799
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,850
to be computed and that means knowing as
many algorithms as possible and also

800
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:14,860
many algorithms as possible and also
 

801
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,190
many algorithms as possible and also
knowing as much data about the world as

802
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:17,200
knowing as much data about the world as
 

803
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,829
knowing as much data about the world as
possible and I kind of view this as sort

804
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:19,839
possible and I kind of view this as sort
 

805
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,600
possible and I kind of view this as sort
of a knowledge-based programming

806
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:21,610
of a knowledge-based programming
 

807
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,780
of a knowledge-based programming
approach where you have you know a

808
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:24,790
approach where you have you know a
 

809
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,310
approach where you have you know a
typical kind of idea in programming

810
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,320
typical kind of idea in programming
 

811
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,050
typical kind of idea in programming
languages is you know you have some

812
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:28,060
languages is you know you have some
 

813
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,550
languages is you know you have some
small programming languages has a few

814
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:29,560
small programming languages has a few
 

815
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,860
small programming languages has a few
primitives that are pretty much tied

816
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:31,870
primitives that are pretty much tied
 

817
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,350
primitives that are pretty much tied
into what a machine can intrinsically do

818
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:34,360
into what a machine can intrinsically do
 

819
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,750
into what a machine can intrinsically do
and then maybe you'll have libraries

820
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:36,760
and then maybe you'll have libraries
 

821
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,250
and then maybe you'll have libraries
that add on to that and so on

822
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:38,260
that add on to that and so on
 

823
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:42,000
that add on to that and so on
my kind of crazy idea of many many years

824
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,010
my kind of crazy idea of many many years
 

825
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,519
my kind of crazy idea of many many years
ago has been to build an integrated

826
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:44,529
ago has been to build an integrated
 

827
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:47,100
ago has been to build an integrated
system where all of the stuff about

828
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,110
system where all of the stuff about
 

829
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,110
system where all of the stuff about
different domains of knowledge and so on

830
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,120
different domains of knowledge and so on
 

831
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,510
different domains of knowledge and so on
are all just built into the system and

832
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:51,520
are all just built into the system and
 

833
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,720
are all just built into the system and
and designed in a coherent way I mean

834
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:54,730
and designed in a coherent way I mean
 

835
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,069
and designed in a coherent way I mean
this has been kind of the story of my

836
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:56,079
this has been kind of the story of my
 

837
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,660
this has been kind of the story of my
life for the last thirty years is trying

838
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:57,670
life for the last thirty years is trying
 

839
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,100
life for the last thirty years is trying
to keep the design of the system

840
00:16:59,100 --> 00:16:59,110
to keep the design of the system
 

841
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:03,090
to keep the design of the system
coherent even as one adds all sorts of

842
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:03,100
coherent even as one adds all sorts of
 

843
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:08,730
coherent even as one adds all sorts of
different areas of of capability so as

844
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:08,740
different areas of of capability so as
 

845
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,829
different areas of of capability so as
some I mean we can go and dive into all

846
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:10,839
some I mean we can go and dive into all
 

847
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,390
some I mean we can go and dive into all
sorts of different kinds of things here

848
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,400
sorts of different kinds of things here
 

849
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,809
sorts of different kinds of things here
but maybe as an example well let's do

850
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:15,819
but maybe as an example well let's do
 

851
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:18,059
but maybe as an example well let's do
what could we do here we could take come

852
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:18,069
what could we do here we could take come
 

853
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:21,210
what could we do here we could take come
let's try how about this is that a bone

854
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:21,220
let's try how about this is that a bone
 

855
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,150
let's try how about this is that a bone
I think so that's a bone so let's try

856
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:24,160
I think so that's a bone so let's try
 

857
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:31,980
I think so that's a bone so let's try
that as a mesh region see if that works

858
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:31,990
that as a mesh region see if that works
 

859
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,870
that as a mesh region see if that works
so this will now use a completely

860
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:33,880
so this will now use a completely
 

861
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,169
so this will now use a completely
different domain of human endeavor okay

862
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:37,179
different domain of human endeavor okay
 

863
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:38,880
different domain of human endeavor okay
oops there's two of those bones let's

864
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:38,890
oops there's two of those bones let's
 

865
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,730
oops there's two of those bones let's
try let's just try them let's try

866
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:42,740
try let's just try them let's try
 

867
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,879
try let's just try them let's try
humorous let's try the that the mesh

868
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:46,889
humorous let's try the that the mesh
 

869
00:17:46,889 --> 00:17:49,310
humorous let's try the that the mesh
region for that and now we should have a

870
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:49,320
region for that and now we should have a
 

871
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,409
region for that and now we should have a
bone here okay there's a there's a

872
00:17:51,409 --> 00:17:51,419
bone here okay there's a there's a
 

873
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:53,480
bone here okay there's a there's a
representation of a bone let's take that

874
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:53,490
representation of a bone let's take that
 

875
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,720
representation of a bone let's take that
bone and we could for example say let's

876
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:56,730
bone and we could for example say let's
 

877
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,960
bone and we could for example say let's
take the surface area of that as in some

878
00:17:59,960 --> 00:17:59,970
take the surface area of that as in some
 

879
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,330
take the surface area of that as in some
some units or I could let's do some much

880
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:02,340
some units or I could let's do some much
 

881
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,990
some units or I could let's do some much
more outrageous thing let's say we take

882
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:05,000
more outrageous thing let's say we take
 

883
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,730
more outrageous thing let's say we take
region distance so we're going to take

884
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:07,740
region distance so we're going to take
 

885
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,990
region distance so we're going to take
the distance from some from that bone to

886
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,000
the distance from some from that bone to
 

887
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,299
the distance from some from that bone to
a point let's say 0 0 Z and let's make a

888
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:17,309
a point let's say 0 0 Z and let's make a
 

889
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:21,409
a point let's say 0 0 Z and let's make a
plot of that distance with Z going from

890
00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:21,419
plot of that distance with Z going from
 

891
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,810
plot of that distance with Z going from
let's say I don't have no idea where the

892
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:23,820
let's say I don't have no idea where the
 

893
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,430
let's say I don't have no idea where the
where the spawn is but let's try

894
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,440
where the spawn is but let's try
 

895
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,470
where the spawn is but let's try
something like this so that was really

896
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:27,480
something like this so that was really
 

897
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:33,289
something like this so that was really
boring um let's try them so what this is

898
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:33,299
boring um let's try them so what this is
 

899
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:35,210
boring um let's try them so what this is
doing again a whole bunch of stuff has

900
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:35,220
doing again a whole bunch of stuff has
 

901
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,460
doing again a whole bunch of stuff has
to work in order for this to operate

902
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:37,470
to work in order for this to operate
 

903
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,499
to work in order for this to operate
this has to be this is a this is some

904
00:18:39,499 --> 00:18:39,509
this has to be this is a this is some
 

905
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:41,600
this has to be this is a this is some
region in 3d space that's represented by

906
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:41,610
region in 3d space that's represented by
 

907
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,999
region in 3d space that's represented by
some mesh you have to compute you know

908
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:44,009
some mesh you have to compute you know
 

909
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:45,529
some mesh you have to compute you know
do the computational geometry to figure

910
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:45,539
do the computational geometry to figure
 

911
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:47,419
do the computational geometry to figure
out where it is if I want it to let's

912
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:47,429
out where it is if I want it to let's
 

913
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:51,889
out where it is if I want it to let's
try anatomy anatomy plot 3d and let's

914
00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:51,899
try anatomy anatomy plot 3d and let's
 

915
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:54,619
try anatomy anatomy plot 3d and let's
say something like left hand for example

916
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:54,629
say something like left hand for example
 

917
00:18:54,629 --> 00:18:56,930
say something like left hand for example
and now it's going to show us probably

918
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:56,940
and now it's going to show us probably
 

919
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,480
and now it's going to show us probably
the complete data that it has about the

920
00:18:59,480 --> 00:18:59,490
the complete data that it has about the
 

921
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:07,490
the complete data that it has about the
geometry of the left hand there we go ok

922
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:07,500
geometry of the left hand there we go ok
 

923
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,840
geometry of the left hand there we go ok
so there's there's the results and we

924
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:08,850
so there's there's the results and we
 

925
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,190
so there's there's the results and we
could take that apart and start

926
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:10,200
could take that apart and start
 

927
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,289
could take that apart and start
computing things from it and so on so

928
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:14,299
computing things from it and so on so
 

929
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:22,460
computing things from it and so on so
what um so this this is some so there's

930
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:22,470
what um so this this is some so there's
 

931
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,230
what um so this this is some so there's
a there's a lot of kind of computational

932
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:24,240
a there's a lot of kind of computational
 

933
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,700
a there's a lot of kind of computational
knowledge that's built in here one let's

934
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:28,710
knowledge that's built in here one let's
 

935
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,019
knowledge that's built in here one let's
talk a little bit about kind of the

936
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:30,029
talk a little bit about kind of the
 

937
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:31,999
talk a little bit about kind of the
modern machine learning story so for

938
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:32,009
modern machine learning story so for
 

939
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:34,100
modern machine learning story so for
instance if I say let's get a picture

940
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:34,110
instance if I say let's get a picture
 

941
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,980
instance if I say let's get a picture
here let's say um let's let's just say

942
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:36,990
here let's say um let's let's just say
 

943
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,769
here let's say um let's let's just say
picture of symbol got a favorite kind of

944
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:39,779
picture of symbol got a favorite kind of
 

945
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:50,779
picture of symbol got a favorite kind of
animal what's Panda okay so let's try ok

946
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:50,789
animal what's Panda okay so let's try ok
 

947
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,550
animal what's Panda okay so let's try ok
giant panda

948
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:52,560
giant panda
 

949
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,610
giant panda
okay okay there's a panda let's see what

950
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:55,620
okay okay there's a panda let's see what
 

951
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,200
okay okay there's a panda let's see what
now let's try saying um let's try for

952
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,210
now let's try saying um let's try for
 

953
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,910
now let's try saying um let's try for
this panda let's try saying image

954
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:01,920
this panda let's try saying image
 

955
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,640
this panda let's try saying image
identify and now here we'll be

956
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:04,650
identify and now here we'll be
 

957
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,470
identify and now here we'll be
embarrassed probably but let's just see

958
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:06,480
embarrassed probably but let's just see
 

959
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,180
embarrassed probably but let's just see
let's see what happens if I say image

960
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:08,190
let's see what happens if I say image
 

961
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:12,080
let's see what happens if I say image
identify that and now it'll hopefully

962
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,090
identify that and now it'll hopefully
 

963
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,630
identify that and now it'll hopefully
wake up wake up wake up this only takes

964
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:14,640
wake up wake up wake up this only takes
 

965
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,740
wake up wake up wake up this only takes
a few hundred milliseconds

966
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:15,750
a few hundred milliseconds
 

967
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,960
a few hundred milliseconds
okay very good giant panda let's let's

968
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:17,970
okay very good giant panda let's let's
 

969
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:18,980
okay very good giant panda let's let's
see what it's we'll see what the

970
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:18,990
see what it's we'll see what the
 

971
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:25,190
see what it's we'll see what the
runners-up were to the giant panda let's

972
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:25,200
runners-up were to the giant panda let's
 

973
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,300
runners-up were to the giant panda let's
say we want to say the ten runners-up in

974
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:29,310
say we want to say the ten runners-up in
 

975
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,450
say we want to say the ten runners-up in
all categories for that thing okay so a

976
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:32,460
all categories for that thing okay so a
 

977
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,930
all categories for that thing okay so a
giant panda a prop here Ned which I've

978
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:35,940
giant panda a prop here Ned which I've
 

979
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,330
giant panda a prop here Ned which I've
never heard of are pandas carniverous

980
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:40,340
never heard of are pandas carniverous
 

981
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,820
never heard of are pandas carniverous
ate bamboo shoots okay so that was so

982
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:43,830
ate bamboo shoots okay so that was so
 

983
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,650
ate bamboo shoots okay so that was so
lucky I didn't get that one it's really

984
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:45,660
lucky I didn't get that one it's really
 

985
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,780
lucky I didn't get that one it's really
sure it's a mammal and it's absolutely

986
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:47,790
sure it's a mammal and it's absolutely
 

987
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,960
sure it's a mammal and it's absolutely
certain it's a vertebrate okay so you

988
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:50,970
certain it's a vertebrate okay so you
 

989
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,660
certain it's a vertebrate okay so you
might ask how did it figure this out and

990
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:53,670
might ask how did it figure this out and
 

991
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,550
might ask how did it figure this out and
so then you can kind of look under the

992
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:55,560
so then you can kind of look under the
 

993
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,340
so then you can kind of look under the
hood and say so we have a whole

994
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:58,350
hood and say so we have a whole
 

995
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,440
hood and say so we have a whole
framework for representing neural nets

996
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:00,450
framework for representing neural nets
 

997
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,020
framework for representing neural nets
symbolically and so this is the actual

998
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:03,030
symbolically and so this is the actual
 

999
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,780
symbolically and so this is the actual
model that it's using to do this so this

1000
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:05,790
model that it's using to do this so this
 

1001
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,330
model that it's using to do this so this
is a so there's a neural net and it's

1002
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:08,340
is a so there's a neural net and it's
 

1003
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,610
is a so there's a neural net and it's
got we can drill down and we can see

1004
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:10,620
got we can drill down and we can see
 

1005
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,080
got we can drill down and we can see
there's there's a piece of the neuron

1006
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,090
there's there's a piece of the neuron
 

1007
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,150
there's there's a piece of the neuron
that we can drill down even further to

1008
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:14,160
that we can drill down even further to
 

1009
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,500
that we can drill down even further to
one of these and we can probably see

1010
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:15,510
one of these and we can probably see
 

1011
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,450
one of these and we can probably see
what that's a batch normalization layer

1012
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:17,460
what that's a batch normalization layer
 

1013
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,000
what that's a batch normalization layer
somewhere deep deep inside the entrails

1014
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,010
somewhere deep deep inside the entrails
 

1015
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:23,810
somewhere deep deep inside the entrails
of the not panda but of this thing okay

1016
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:23,820
of the not panda but of this thing okay
 

1017
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,970
of the not panda but of this thing okay
so now let's take that object which is

1018
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:25,980
so now let's take that object which is
 

1019
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,770
so now let's take that object which is
just a symbolic object and let's feed it

1020
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:27,780
just a symbolic object and let's feed it
 

1021
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,500
just a symbolic object and let's feed it
the picture of the Panda and we can see

1022
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:30,510
the picture of the Panda and we can see
 

1023
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:35,690
the picture of the Panda and we can see
and there oops I was not giving it the

1024
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:35,700
and there oops I was not giving it the
 

1025
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,040
and there oops I was not giving it the
right thing what did I just do wrong

1026
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,050
right thing what did I just do wrong
 

1027
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,470
right thing what did I just do wrong
here okay let's let's take our isolated

1028
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:39,480
here okay let's let's take our isolated
 

1029
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,200
here okay let's let's take our isolated
okay let's take this thing and feed it

1030
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,210
okay let's take this thing and feed it
 

1031
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,580
okay let's take this thing and feed it
the picture of the Panda and it says a

1032
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:43,590
the picture of the Panda and it says a
 

1033
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,800
the picture of the Panda and it says a
giant panda okay how about we do

1034
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:45,810
giant panda okay how about we do
 

1035
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,510
giant panda okay how about we do
something more outrageous let's take

1036
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:47,520
something more outrageous let's take
 

1037
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,910
something more outrageous let's take
that neuron that and let's only use the

1038
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:49,920
that neuron that and let's only use the
 

1039
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,190
that neuron that and let's only use the
first let's say 10 layers of the neuron

1040
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:52,200
first let's say 10 layers of the neuron
 

1041
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,590
first let's say 10 layers of the neuron
that so let's just take out 10 layers of

1042
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:54,600
that so let's just take out 10 layers of
 

1043
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,360
that so let's just take out 10 layers of
the neuron that's and feed it the Panda

1044
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:56,370
the neuron that's and feed it the Panda
 

1045
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,030
the neuron that's and feed it the Panda
and now what we'll get is something from

1046
00:21:59,030 --> 00:21:59,040
and now what we'll get is something from
 

1047
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,280
and now what we'll get is something from
the insides of the neuron that and I

1048
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:01,290
the insides of the neuron that and I
 

1049
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,960
the insides of the neuron that and I
could say for example let's just make

1050
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:02,970
could say for example let's just make
 

1051
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,580
could say for example let's just make
those into images okay so that's what

1052
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:04,590
those into images okay so that's what
 

1053
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,050
those into images okay so that's what
that's what the neuron that

1054
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:06,060
that's what the neuron that
 

1055
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:10,250
that's what the neuron that
had figured out about the Panda after 10

1056
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:10,260
had figured out about the Panda after 10
 

1057
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,690
had figured out about the Panda after 10
layers of going through the neuron that

1058
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:11,700
layers of going through the neuron that
 

1059
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,790
layers of going through the neuron that
and maybe actually be interesting to see

1060
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:13,800
and maybe actually be interesting to see
 

1061
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,830
and maybe actually be interesting to see
let's do a feature space plots and now

1062
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:15,840
let's do a feature space plots and now
 

1063
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,070
let's do a feature space plots and now
we're going to of those intermediate

1064
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:19,080
we're going to of those intermediate
 

1065
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,110
we're going to of those intermediate
things in the sort of in the brain of

1066
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,120
things in the sort of in the brain of
 

1067
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,180
things in the sort of in the brain of
the neuron that sort of speak this is

1068
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:23,190
the neuron that sort of speak this is
 

1069
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,910
the neuron that sort of speak this is
now taking so what this is just doing is

1070
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:25,920
now taking so what this is just doing is
 

1071
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:31,040
now taking so what this is just doing is
to do dimension reduction on this space

1072
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,050
to do dimension reduction on this space
 

1073
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,870
to do dimension reduction on this space
of images and so it's not very exciting

1074
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:32,880
of images and so it's not very exciting
 

1075
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,370
of images and so it's not very exciting
it's probably mostly distinguishing

1076
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:34,380
it's probably mostly distinguishing
 

1077
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,650
it's probably mostly distinguishing
these by total gray level but that's

1078
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:36,660
these by total gray level but that's
 

1079
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,780
these by total gray level but that's
kind of showing us the space of of

1080
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:38,790
kind of showing us the space of of
 

1081
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,420
kind of showing us the space of of
different ton of different sort of

1082
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:41,430
different ton of different sort of
 

1083
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,890
different ton of different sort of
features of the insides of the Shinra on

1084
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:42,900
features of the insides of the Shinra on
 

1085
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,750
features of the insides of the Shinra on
that so it's also what's interesting to

1086
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:44,760
that so it's also what's interesting to
 

1087
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,030
that so it's also what's interesting to
see here is things like the symbolic

1088
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,040
see here is things like the symbolic
 

1089
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,500
see here is things like the symbolic
representation of the neuron that's and

1090
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:48,510
representation of the neuron that's and
 

1091
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,580
representation of the neuron that's and
if you if you're wondering how does that

1092
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:49,590
if you if you're wondering how does that
 

1093
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,560
if you if you're wondering how does that
hatch will work inside it's underneath

1094
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:51,570
hatch will work inside it's underneath
 

1095
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,480
hatch will work inside it's underneath
it's using a max net which we happen to

1096
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:53,490
it's using a max net which we happen to
 

1097
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,910
it's using a max net which we happen to
have contributed to a lot and there's

1098
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:55,920
have contributed to a lot and there's
 

1099
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,380
have contributed to a lot and there's
sort of a bunch of symbolic layers on

1100
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:57,390
sort of a bunch of symbolic layers on
 

1101
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,020
sort of a bunch of symbolic layers on
top of that that feed into that and

1102
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,030
top of that that feed into that and
 

1103
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,670
top of that that feed into that and
maybe I can show you here let me show

1104
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:01,680
maybe I can show you here let me show
 

1105
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,780
maybe I can show you here let me show
you how you would train one of these

1106
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:02,790
you how you would train one of these
 

1107
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:05,740
you how you would train one of these
neural nets that's also kind of fun so

1108
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:05,750
neural nets that's also kind of fun so
 

1109
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,480
neural nets that's also kind of fun so
we have a data repository that has all

1110
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:08,490
we have a data repository that has all
 

1111
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,880
we have a data repository that has all
sorts of useful data one piece of data

1112
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:10,890
sorts of useful data one piece of data
 

1113
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,040
sorts of useful data one piece of data
it has is a bunch of neuron that

1114
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,050
it has is a bunch of neuron that
 

1115
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,920
it has is a bunch of neuron that
training sets so this is a standard emne

1116
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:15,930
training sets so this is a standard emne
 

1117
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,950
training sets so this is a standard emne
straining set of handwritten digits

1118
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:18,960
straining set of handwritten digits
 

1119
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,260
straining set of handwritten digits
okay so there's m missed and you notice

1120
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:21,270
okay so there's m missed and you notice
 

1121
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,910
okay so there's m missed and you notice
that these things here that's just an

1122
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:22,920
that these things here that's just an
 

1123
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,680
that these things here that's just an
image which i could copy out and i could

1124
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:24,690
image which i could copy out and i could
 

1125
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:27,500
image which i could copy out and i could
do you know let's say I could do color

1126
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:27,510
do you know let's say I could do color
 

1127
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,390
do you know let's say I could do color
negate on that image because it's just

1128
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:29,400
negate on that image because it's just
 

1129
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,270
negate on that image because it's just
an image and there's there's the results

1130
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:32,280
an image and there's there's the results
 

1131
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,210
an image and there's there's the results
and so on and now I could say let's take

1132
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:35,220
and so on and now I could say let's take
 

1133
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,980
and so on and now I could say let's take
let's take a neuron that like let's take

1134
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:36,990
let's take a neuron that like let's take
 

1135
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,780
let's take a neuron that like let's take
a simple neuron that like Linette for

1136
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:38,790
a simple neuron that like Linette for
 

1137
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,960
a simple neuron that like Linette for
example okay so let's take Linette and

1138
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:41,970
example okay so let's take Linette and
 

1139
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:45,950
example okay so let's take Linette and
then let's take the untrained initial

1140
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:45,960
then let's take the untrained initial
 

1141
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,780
then let's take the untrained initial
evaluation Network so this is now a

1142
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:47,790
evaluation Network so this is now a
 

1143
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,120
evaluation Network so this is now a
version of Linette simple standard

1144
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,130
version of Linette simple standard
 

1145
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,700
version of Linette simple standard
neural nets that didn't get trained so

1146
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:52,710
neural nets that didn't get trained so
 

1147
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,680
neural nets that didn't get trained so
for example if I if I take that that

1148
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:54,690
for example if I if I take that that
 

1149
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:57,260
for example if I if I take that that
symbolic representation of Lynette and I

1150
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:57,270
symbolic representation of Lynette and I
 

1151
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,960
symbolic representation of Lynette and I
could say net initialize then it will

1152
00:23:59,960 --> 00:23:59,970
could say net initialize then it will
 

1153
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,240
could say net initialize then it will
take that and it'll just put random

1154
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:02,250
take that and it'll just put random
 

1155
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,820
take that and it'll just put random
weights into Lynette okay so if I take

1156
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:04,830
weights into Lynette okay so if I take
 

1157
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,980
weights into Lynette okay so if I take
those random weights and I feed it a

1158
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:06,990
those random weights and I feed it a
 

1159
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:09,710
those random weights and I feed it a
zero here I feed it that image of a zero

1160
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:09,720
zero here I feed it that image of a zero
 

1161
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,930
zero here I feed it that image of a zero
it will presumably produce something

1162
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:11,940
it will presumably produce something
 

1163
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,280
it will presumably produce something
completely random in this particular

1164
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:13,290
completely random in this particular
 

1165
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:16,610
completely random in this particular
case - right so now now what I would

1166
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:16,620
case - right so now now what I would
 

1167
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,380
case - right so now now what I would
like to do is to take this so that was

1168
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:18,390
like to do is to take this so that was
 

1169
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,180
like to do is to take this so that was
just randomly initializing the weights

1170
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:20,190
just randomly initializing the weights
 

1171
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,480
just randomly initializing the weights
so now what I'd like to do is to take

1172
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:22,490
so now what I'd like to do is to take
 

1173
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:25,010
so now what I'd like to do is to take
the emne straining set and I'd like to

1174
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:25,020
the emne straining set and I'd like to
 

1175
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,760
the emne straining set and I'd like to
actually train Lynette using MMS

1176
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:28,770
actually train Lynette using MMS
 

1177
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,650
actually train Lynette using MMS
training set so let's take let's take

1178
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:30,660
training set so let's take let's take
 

1179
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,780
training set so let's take let's take
this and let's take a random sample of

1180
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:34,790
this and let's take a random sample of
 

1181
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:38,180
this and let's take a random sample of
let's say I don't know a thousand pieces

1182
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:38,190
let's say I don't know a thousand pieces
 

1183
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:41,570
let's say I don't know a thousand pieces
of Lynette come on why is it having to

1184
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:41,580
of Lynette come on why is it having to
 

1185
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,310
of Lynette come on why is it having to
load it again there we go okay so

1186
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:43,320
load it again there we go okay so
 

1187
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,260
load it again there we go okay so
there's a there's a random sample there

1188
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:45,270
there's a there's a random sample there
 

1189
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,540
there's a there's a random sample there
was on line 21 and now let me go down

1190
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:47,550
was on line 21 and now let me go down
 

1191
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:51,890
was on line 21 and now let me go down
here and say where was it well look we

1192
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:51,900
here and say where was it well look we
 

1193
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,500
here and say where was it well look we
can just take this this thing here so

1194
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:54,510
can just take this this thing here so
 

1195
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,140
can just take this this thing here so
this is the uninitialized version of

1196
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:57,150
this is the uninitialized version of
 

1197
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,780
this is the uninitialized version of
Lynette and we can say take that and

1198
00:24:59,780 --> 00:24:59,790
Lynette and we can say take that and
 

1199
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:03,350
Lynette and we can say take that and
then let's say net train of that with

1200
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:03,360
then let's say net train of that with
 

1201
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,390
then let's say net train of that with
the thing on line 21 which was that

1202
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:05,400
the thing on line 21 which was that
 

1203
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,070
the thing on line 21 which was that
thousand instances so now what it's

1204
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,080
thousand instances so now what it's
 

1205
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,670
thousand instances so now what it's
doing is its running training on and

1206
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:10,680
doing is its running training on and
 

1207
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,830
doing is its running training on and
that's you see the loss going down and

1208
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:12,840
that's you see the loss going down and
 

1209
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,980
that's you see the loss going down and
so on it's running training for for

1210
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:15,990
so on it's running training for for
 

1211
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:19,820
so on it's running training for for
those thousand instances of Lynette and

1212
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:19,830
those thousand instances of Lynette and
 

1213
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,590
those thousand instances of Lynette and
it will we can stop it if we want to

1214
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:21,600
it will we can stop it if we want to
 

1215
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,720
it will we can stop it if we want to
actually this is a new display this is

1216
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:23,730
actually this is a new display this is
 

1217
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,320
actually this is a new display this is
very nice

1218
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:24,330
very nice
 

1219
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,030
very nice
this is this is a new version of both

1220
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:26,040
this is this is a new version of both
 

1221
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,920
this is this is a new version of both
languages is coming out next week which

1222
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:27,930
languages is coming out next week which
 

1223
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,260
languages is coming out next week which
I'm showing you but it's quite similar

1224
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:30,270
I'm showing you but it's quite similar
 

1225
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,990
I'm showing you but it's quite similar
to what exists today but because that's

1226
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,000
to what exists today but because that's
 

1227
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,310
to what exists today but because that's
one of the features of running a

1228
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:34,320
one of the features of running a
 

1229
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,750
one of the features of running a
software company is that you always run

1230
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:35,760
software company is that you always run
 

1231
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,610
software company is that you always run
the the very latest version of things

1232
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:37,620
the the very latest version of things
 

1233
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,160
the the very latest version of things
for better or worse and that's and this

1234
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,170
for better or worse and that's and this
 

1235
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,540
for better or worse and that's and this
is also a good way to debug it because

1236
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:41,550
is also a good way to debug it because
 

1237
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,280
is also a good way to debug it because
supposed to come out next week if I find

1238
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:43,290
supposed to come out next week if I find
 

1239
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,320
supposed to come out next week if I find
some horrifying bug maybe it will get

1240
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:45,330
some horrifying bug maybe it will get
 

1241
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:50,240
some horrifying bug maybe it will get
delayed but let's try them let's sum

1242
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,250
delayed but let's try them let's sum
 

1243
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,180
delayed but let's try them let's sum
let's try this okay now it says it's

1244
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:53,190
let's try this okay now it says it's
 

1245
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,380
let's try this okay now it says it's
zero okay

1246
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:54,390
zero okay
 

1247
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,990
zero okay
and so so this is now a trained version

1248
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:57,000
and so so this is now a trained version
 

1249
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,360
and so so this is now a trained version
of Lynette trained with that with that

1250
00:25:59,360 --> 00:25:59,370
of Lynette trained with that with that
 

1251
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:03,140
of Lynette trained with that with that
training data um one of the things so

1252
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:03,150
training data um one of the things so
 

1253
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,850
training data um one of the things so
you know we can talk about all kinds of

1254
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:04,860
you know we can talk about all kinds of
 

1255
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,250
you know we can talk about all kinds of
details of your mats and so on but maybe

1256
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:07,260
details of your mats and so on but maybe
 

1257
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,780
details of your mats and so on but maybe
I should zoom out to talk a little bit

1258
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:08,790
I should zoom out to talk a little bit
 

1259
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:14,030
I should zoom out to talk a little bit
about bigger picture as I see it so one

1260
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,040
about bigger picture as I see it so one
 

1261
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,110
about bigger picture as I see it so one
question is sort of a question of what

1262
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:18,120
question is sort of a question of what
 

1263
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,270
question is sort of a question of what
is in principle possible to do with

1264
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:20,280
is in principle possible to do with
 

1265
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,300
is in principle possible to do with
computation so you know we have as we're

1266
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:23,310
computation so you know we have as we're
 

1267
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,530
computation so you know we have as we're
you know we're building all kinds of

1268
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:24,540
you know we're building all kinds of
 

1269
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,060
you know we're building all kinds of
things we're making image identifies

1270
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:26,070
things we're making image identifies
 

1271
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,430
things we're making image identifies
we're figuring out those kinds of things

1272
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:28,440
we're figuring out those kinds of things
 

1273
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,720
we're figuring out those kinds of things
about where the International Space

1274
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:29,730
about where the International Space
 

1275
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,240
about where the International Space
Station is and so on question is what is

1276
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,250
Station is and so on question is what is
 

1277
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,640
Station is and so on question is what is
what is in principle

1278
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:33,650
what is in principle
 

1279
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,720
what is in principle
possible to compute and so the you know

1280
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:37,730
possible to compute and so the you know
 

1281
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,100
possible to compute and so the you know
one of the places one can ask that

1282
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:39,110
one of the places one can ask that
 

1283
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,470
one of the places one can ask that
question is when one looks at for

1284
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:41,480
question is when one looks at for
 

1285
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,300
question is when one looks at for
example models of the natural world one

1286
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:43,310
example models of the natural world one
 

1287
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,920
example models of the natural world one
can say you know how do we make models

1288
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:44,930
can say you know how do we make models
 

1289
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,750
can say you know how do we make models
of the natural world kind of a a

1290
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:46,760
of the natural world kind of a a
 

1291
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,270
of the natural world kind of a a
traditional approach has been let's use

1292
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:49,280
traditional approach has been let's use
 

1293
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,040
traditional approach has been let's use
mathematical equations to make models of

1294
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,050
mathematical equations to make models of
 

1295
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:53,980
mathematical equations to make models of
the natural world a question is if we

1296
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:53,990
the natural world a question is if we
 

1297
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,570
the natural world a question is if we
want to kind of generalize that and say

1298
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:55,580
want to kind of generalize that and say
 

1299
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,160
want to kind of generalize that and say
well what are all possible ways to make

1300
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,170
well what are all possible ways to make
 

1301
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:59,230
well what are all possible ways to make
models of things what can we say about

1302
00:26:59,230 --> 00:26:59,240
models of things what can we say about
 

1303
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,530
models of things what can we say about
that question so I spent many years of

1304
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:02,540
that question so I spent many years of
 

1305
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,970
that question so I spent many years of
my life trying to address that question

1306
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:03,980
my life trying to address that question
 

1307
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,910
my life trying to address that question
and basically what what I've thought

1308
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:06,920
and basically what what I've thought
 

1309
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,880
and basically what what I've thought
about a lot is that if you want to make

1310
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:09,890
about a lot is that if you want to make
 

1311
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,230
about a lot is that if you want to make
a model of a thing you have to have

1312
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:11,240
a model of a thing you have to have
 

1313
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,700
a model of a thing you have to have
definite rules by which the thing

1314
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:12,710
definite rules by which the thing
 

1315
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,680
definite rules by which the thing
operates what's the most general way to

1316
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:14,690
operates what's the most general way to
 

1317
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,470
operates what's the most general way to
represent possible rules well in today's

1318
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:17,480
represent possible rules well in today's
 

1319
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,660
represent possible rules well in today's
world we think of that as a program so

1320
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:19,670
world we think of that as a program so
 

1321
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,310
world we think of that as a program so
the next question is well what does the

1322
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:21,320
the next question is well what does the
 

1323
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,990
the next question is well what does the
space of all possible programs look like

1324
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:23,000
space of all possible programs look like
 

1325
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,180
space of all possible programs look like
and most of the time you know we're

1326
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:25,190
and most of the time you know we're
 

1327
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,250
and most of the time you know we're
writing programs like Wolfen language is

1328
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:27,260
writing programs like Wolfen language is
 

1329
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,650
writing programs like Wolfen language is
50 million lines of code and it's a big

1330
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:29,660
50 million lines of code and it's a big
 

1331
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,600
50 million lines of code and it's a big
complicated program that was for built

1332
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:31,610
complicated program that was for built
 

1333
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:34,390
complicated program that was for built
for a fairly specific purpose but the

1334
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:34,400
for a fairly specific purpose but the
 

1335
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,070
for a fairly specific purpose but the
question is if we just look at sort of

1336
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,080
question is if we just look at sort of
 

1337
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,230
question is if we just look at sort of
the space of possible programs more or

1338
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:38,240
the space of possible programs more or
 

1339
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,700
the space of possible programs more or
less at random what's out there in the

1340
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:39,710
less at random what's out there in the
 

1341
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,920
less at random what's out there in the
space of possible program so I got an

1342
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:41,930
space of possible program so I got an
 

1343
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,720
space of possible program so I got an
interest in many years ago in cellular

1344
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:43,730
interest in many years ago in cellular
 

1345
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,370
interest in many years ago in cellular
automata which are a really good example

1346
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:45,380
automata which are a really good example
 

1347
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:48,430
automata which are a really good example
of a very simple kind of program so let

1348
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:48,440
of a very simple kind of program so let
 

1349
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,750
of a very simple kind of program so let
me show you an example of one of these

1350
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:49,760
me show you an example of one of these
 

1351
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,790
me show you an example of one of these
so this is these are the rules for a

1352
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:51,800
so this is these are the rules for a
 

1353
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,700
so this is these are the rules for a
typical cellular automaton and this just

1354
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:54,710
typical cellular automaton and this just
 

1355
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,160
typical cellular automaton and this just
says you have a row of black and white

1356
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:57,170
says you have a row of black and white
 

1357
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:59,290
says you have a row of black and white
squares and this just says you look at a

1358
00:27:59,290 --> 00:27:59,300
squares and this just says you look at a
 

1359
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,720
squares and this just says you look at a
black a look at a square say what color

1360
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:01,730
black a look at a square say what color
 

1361
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,550
black a look at a square say what color
is that square what color left or it's

1362
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:03,560
is that square what color left or it's
 

1363
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,620
is that square what color left or it's
left and right neighbors decide what

1364
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:05,630
left and right neighbors decide what
 

1365
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,880
left and right neighbors decide what
color the square will be on the next

1366
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:06,890
color the square will be on the next
 

1367
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,190
color the square will be on the next
step based on that rule okay so really

1368
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:09,200
step based on that rule okay so really
 

1369
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,500
step based on that rule okay so really
simple rule so now let's let's take a

1370
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:11,510
simple rule so now let's let's take a
 

1371
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,810
simple rule so now let's let's take a
look at what what actually happens if we

1372
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:13,820
look at what what actually happens if we
 

1373
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,760
look at what what actually happens if we
use that rule a bunch of times so we can

1374
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:15,770
use that rule a bunch of times so we can
 

1375
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:18,670
use that rule a bunch of times so we can
take that rule the 254 is just the

1376
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:18,680
take that rule the 254 is just the
 

1377
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,790
take that rule the 254 is just the
binary digits that correspond to those

1378
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:21,800
binary digits that correspond to those
 

1379
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,640
binary digits that correspond to those
positions in this rule so now I can say

1380
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:24,650
positions in this rule so now I can say
 

1381
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,890
positions in this rule so now I can say
this I could say let's do 50 steps let

1382
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:26,900
this I could say let's do 50 steps let
 

1383
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,780
this I could say let's do 50 steps let
me do this sum and now if I run

1384
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:30,790
me do this sum and now if I run
 

1385
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:33,250
me do this sum and now if I run
according to the rule I just defined it

1386
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:33,260
according to the rule I just defined it
 

1387
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,950
according to the rule I just defined it
turns out to be pretty trivial it's just

1388
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:35,960
turns out to be pretty trivial it's just
 

1389
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,340
turns out to be pretty trivial it's just
saying if any if any square is if we

1390
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:39,350
saying if any if any square is if we
 

1391
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,840
saying if any if any square is if we
start off with a black square if any

1392
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:40,850
start off with a black square if any
 

1393
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:43,450
start off with a black square if any
square is if any neighboring square is

1394
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:43,460
square is if any neighboring square is
 

1395
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,520
square is if any neighboring square is
black make a black square so we've we've

1396
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:45,530
black make a black square so we've we've
 

1397
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:47,140
black make a black square so we've we've
used a very simple program

1398
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:47,150
used a very simple program
 

1399
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:49,240
used a very simple program
we've got a very simple results out okay

1400
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:49,250
we've got a very simple results out okay
 

1401
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,830
we've got a very simple results out okay
let's try a different program we can try

1402
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:50,840
let's try a different program we can try
 

1403
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,470
let's try a different program we can try
changing this we'll get some that's a

1404
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:53,480
changing this we'll get some that's a
 

1405
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,170
changing this we'll get some that's a
program with one bit different now we

1406
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:56,180
program with one bit different now we
 

1407
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,420
program with one bit different now we
get that kind of pattern so the question

1408
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:58,430
get that kind of pattern so the question
 

1409
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:01,570
get that kind of pattern so the question
is well what happens you might say okay

1410
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:01,580
is well what happens you might say okay
 

1411
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,830
is well what happens you might say okay
if you've got such a trivial program

1412
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:02,840
if you've got such a trivial program
 

1413
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,240
if you've got such a trivial program
it's not surprising you're just going to

1414
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,250
it's not surprising you're just going to
 

1415
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,880
it's not surprising you're just going to
get Trevor a results out so but you can

1416
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:06,890
get Trevor a results out so but you can
 

1417
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,920
get Trevor a results out so but you can
do an experiment to test that hypothesis

1418
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:08,930
do an experiment to test that hypothesis
 

1419
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,660
do an experiment to test that hypothesis
you can just say let's take all possible

1420
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:10,670
you can just say let's take all possible
 

1421
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:13,299
you can just say let's take all possible
programs there are 256 possible programs

1422
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:13,309
programs there are 256 possible programs
 

1423
00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:15,880
programs there are 256 possible programs
that are based on these eight bits here

1424
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:15,890
that are based on these eight bits here
 

1425
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,700
that are based on these eight bits here
let's just take well let's just whoops

1426
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:18,710
let's just take well let's just whoops
 

1427
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:22,780
let's just take well let's just whoops
let's just take come let's say the first

1428
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:22,790
let's just take come let's say the first
 

1429
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,600
let's just take come let's say the first
64 of those programs and let's just make

1430
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:25,610
64 of those programs and let's just make
 

1431
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:30,730
64 of those programs and let's just make
a echo let's just make a table of the

1432
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:30,740
a echo let's just make a table of the
 

1433
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,799
a echo let's just make a table of the
results that we get by running those

1434
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:32,809
results that we get by running those
 

1435
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:36,130
results that we get by running those
first 64 programs here so here we get

1436
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:36,140
first 64 programs here so here we get
 

1437
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,710
first 64 programs here so here we get
the result and what you see is well most

1438
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:38,720
the result and what you see is well most
 

1439
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,240
the result and what you see is well most
of them are pretty trivially the lake

1440
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:40,250
of them are pretty trivially the lake
 

1441
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,710
of them are pretty trivially the lake
they start off with one black cell in

1442
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:41,720
they start off with one black cell in
 

1443
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,180
they start off with one black cell in
the middle and it just tools after one

1444
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:43,190
the middle and it just tools after one
 

1445
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,190
the middle and it just tools after one
side occasionally we get something more

1446
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:45,200
side occasionally we get something more
 

1447
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,720
side occasionally we get something more
exciting happening like here's a nice

1448
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:46,730
exciting happening like here's a nice
 

1449
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,850
exciting happening like here's a nice
nested pattern that we get if we were to

1450
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:48,860
nested pattern that we get if we were to
 

1451
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,350
nested pattern that we get if we were to
continue it longer it would it would

1452
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:50,360
continue it longer it would it would
 

1453
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,680
continue it longer it would it would
make you know more detailed nesting but

1454
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:53,690
make you know more detailed nesting but
 

1455
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:56,770
make you know more detailed nesting but
then my all-time favorite science

1456
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:56,780
then my all-time favorite science
 

1457
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,900
then my all-time favorite science
discovery if you go on and just look at

1458
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:58,910
discovery if you go on and just look at
 

1459
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:01,570
discovery if you go on and just look at
these after a while you find this one

1460
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:01,580
these after a while you find this one
 

1461
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,900
these after a while you find this one
here which is rule 30 in this in this

1462
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:04,910
here which is rule 30 in this in this
 

1463
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,640
here which is rule 30 in this in this
numbering scheme and that's doing

1464
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:06,650
numbering scheme and that's doing
 

1465
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:08,560
numbering scheme and that's doing
something a bit more complicated you say

1466
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:08,570
something a bit more complicated you say
 

1467
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,120
something a bit more complicated you say
well what's going on here you know we

1468
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,130
well what's going on here you know we
 

1469
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,560
well what's going on here you know we
just started off with this very simple

1470
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:11,570
just started off with this very simple
 

1471
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,720
just started off with this very simple
rule let's see what happens maybe after

1472
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:13,730
rule let's see what happens maybe after
 

1473
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,090
rule let's see what happens maybe after
a while you know if we run rule 30 long

1474
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:16,100
a while you know if we run rule 30 long
 

1475
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,549
a while you know if we run rule 30 long
enough it will resolve into something

1476
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:18,559
enough it will resolve into something
 

1477
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:19,930
enough it will resolve into something
simpler so let's try running it let's

1478
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:19,940
simpler so let's try running it let's
 

1479
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,680
simpler so let's try running it let's
say 500 steps and that's the whoops

1480
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:23,690
say 500 steps and that's the whoops
 

1481
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:28,750
say 500 steps and that's the whoops
that's the result we get I'd say let's

1482
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:28,760
that's the result we get I'd say let's
 

1483
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:33,340
that's the result we get I'd say let's
just make it fullscreen okay

1484
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:33,350
just make it fullscreen okay
 

1485
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,230
just make it fullscreen okay
it's aliasing a bit on the projector

1486
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:35,240
it's aliasing a bit on the projector
 

1487
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,480
it's aliasing a bit on the projector
there but but you get the basic idea

1488
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:37,490
there but but you get the basic idea
 

1489
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,760
there but but you get the basic idea
this is a so this just started off from

1490
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:39,770
this is a so this just started off from
 

1491
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,740
this is a so this just started off from
one black cell at the top and this is

1492
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:41,750
one black cell at the top and this is
 

1493
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,540
one black cell at the top and this is
what it made and that's pretty weird

1494
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:43,550
what it made and that's pretty weird
 

1495
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,150
what it made and that's pretty weird
because all this is you know this is

1496
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:46,160
because all this is you know this is
 

1497
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,430
because all this is you know this is
sort of not the way it's supposed things

1498
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:48,440
sort of not the way it's supposed things
 

1499
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,720
sort of not the way it's supposed things
are supposed to work because what we

1500
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:49,730
are supposed to work because what we
 

1501
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:52,390
are supposed to work because what we
have here is just that little program

1502
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:52,400
have here is just that little program
 

1503
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,340
have here is just that little program
down there and it makes this big

1504
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:54,350
down there and it makes this big
 

1505
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,650
down there and it makes this big
complicated pattern here and you know we

1506
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:56,660
complicated pattern here and you know we
 

1507
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,640
complicated pattern here and you know we
can see there's a certain amount of

1508
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:57,650
can see there's a certain amount of
 

1509
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,100
can see there's a certain amount of
regularity on one side but for example

1510
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:00,110
regularity on one side but for example
 

1511
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:00,970
regularity on one side but for example
the center column

1512
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:00,980
the center column
 

1513
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,620
the center column
this pattern is for all practical

00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:02,630
this pattern is for all practical

modeling the natural world because you
 

1543
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,750
modeling the natural world because you

00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:37,760
might think that there are programs that
 

1545
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,880
might think that there are programs that
represent systems in nature that might

1546
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:39,890
represent systems in nature that might
 

1547
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,169
represent systems in nature that might
work this way and so on it's also

1548
00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:41,179
work this way and so on it's also
 

1549
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:44,080
work this way and so on it's also
important for technology because it says

1550
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:44,090
important for technology because it says
 

1551
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:47,370
important for technology because it says
ok let's say you're trying to find a

1552
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:47,380
ok let's say you're trying to find a
 

1553
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,120
ok let's say you're trying to find a
let's say you're trying to find a

1554
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,130
let's say you're trying to find a
 

1555
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,289
let's say you're trying to find a
program that's a good random number

1556
00:31:50,289 --> 00:31:50,299
program that's a good random number
 

1557
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:51,430
program that's a good random number
generator how are you going to do that

1558
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:51,440
generator how are you going to do that
 

1559
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,560
generator how are you going to do that
well you could start thinking very hard

1560
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:53,570
well you could start thinking very hard
 

1561
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,240
well you could start thinking very hard
and you could try makeup you know you

1562
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:55,250
and you could try makeup you know you
 

1563
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,159
and you could try makeup you know you
could try and write down all kinds of

1564
00:31:57,159 --> 00:31:57,169
could try and write down all kinds of
 

1565
00:31:57,169 --> 00:31:58,720
could try and write down all kinds of
flowcharts about how this random number

1566
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:58,730
flowcharts about how this random number
 

1567
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:00,460
flowcharts about how this random number
generator is going to work or you can

1568
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:00,470
generator is going to work or you can
 

1569
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,960
generator is going to work or you can
say forget that I'm just going to search

1570
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:01,970
say forget that I'm just going to search
 

1571
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,640
say forget that I'm just going to search
the computational universe for possible

1572
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:03,650
the computational universe for possible
 

1573
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,669
the computational universe for possible
programs and just look for one that

1574
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:05,679
programs and just look for one that
 

1575
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,990
programs and just look for one that
serves as a good random number generator

1576
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:08,000
serves as a good random number generator
 

1577
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,340
serves as a good random number generator
in this particular case after you've

1578
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:09,350
in this particular case after you've
 

1579
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,799
in this particular case after you've
searched 30 programs you'll find one

1580
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:11,809
searched 30 programs you'll find one
 

1581
00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:12,820
searched 30 programs you'll find one
that makes a good random number

1582
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:12,830
that makes a good random number
 

1583
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,400
that makes a good random number
generator why does it work that's a

1584
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:15,410
generator why does it work that's a
 

1585
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,530
generator why does it work that's a
complicated story it's not a story that

1586
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:17,540
complicated story it's not a story that
 

1587
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:20,140
complicated story it's not a story that
I think necessarily we can really tell

1588
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:20,150
I think necessarily we can really tell
 

1589
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,510
I think necessarily we can really tell
very well but what's important is that

1590
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:22,520
very well but what's important is that
 

1591
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,610
very well but what's important is that
this is this idea that out in the

1592
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:24,620
this is this idea that out in the
 

1593
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,230
this is this idea that out in the
computational universe there's a lot of

00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:26,240
computational universe there's a lot of
 

1595
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,620
computational universe there's a lot of
rich sophisticated stuff that can be

1596
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:29,630
rich sophisticated stuff that can be
 

1597
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,750
rich sophisticated stuff that can be
essentially mind for our technological

00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:31,760
essentially mind for our technological
 

1599
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,730
essentially mind for our technological
purposes that's the important thing

1600
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:33,740
purposes that's the important thing
 

1601
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,490
purposes that's the important thing
whether we understand how this works is

1602
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:36,500
whether we understand how this works is
 

1603
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,140
whether we understand how this works is
a different matter I mean it's like when

1604
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,150
a different matter I mean it's like when
 

1605
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,490
a different matter I mean it's like when
we look at the natural world the

1606
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:39,500
we look at the natural world the
 

1607
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,590
we look at the natural world the
physical world were used to kind of

1608
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:41,600
physical world were used to kind of
 

1609
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,360
physical world were used to kind of
mining things you know we started using

1610
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:43,370
mining things you know we started using
 

1611
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:46,480
mining things you know we started using
magnets to do magnetic stuff long before

1612
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:46,490
magnets to do magnetic stuff long before
 

1613
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,220
magnets to do magnetic stuff long before
we understand understood the theory of

1614
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:48,230
we understand understood the theory of
 

1615
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,289
we understand understood the theory of
ferromagnetism and so on and so

1616
00:32:50,289 --> 00:32:50,299
ferromagnetism and so on and so
 

1617
00:32:50,299 --> 00:32:52,659
ferromagnetism and so on and so
similarly here we can sort of go out

1618
00:32:52,659 --> 00:32:52,669
similarly here we can sort of go out
 

1619
00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:54,760
similarly here we can sort of go out
into the computational universe and find

1620
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:54,770
into the computational universe and find
 

1621
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:57,370
into the computational universe and find
stuff that's useful for our purposes now

1622
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:57,380
stuff that's useful for our purposes now
 

1623
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,460
stuff that's useful for our purposes now
in fact the world of sort of deep

00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:01,760
learning and neural nets and so on is a
 

1627
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,880
learning and neural nets and so on is a
little bit like this it uses the trick

1628
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:03,890
little bit like this it uses the trick
 

1629
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,380
little bit like this it uses the trick
that there's a certain degree of

1630
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:05,390
that there's a certain degree of
 

1631
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,299
that there's a certain degree of
differentiability there so you can kind

1632
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:07,309
differentiability there so you can kind
 

1633
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:09,640
differentiability there so you can kind
of home in on let's try and find

1634
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:09,650
of home in on let's try and find
 

1635
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,049

00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:11,059
something that's incremental II better
 

1637
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:13,090
something that's incremental II better
and for certain kinds of problems that

1638
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:13,100
and for certain kinds of problems that
 

1639
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,560
and for certain kinds of problems that
works pretty well

1640
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:14,570
works pretty well
 

1641
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:16,180
works pretty well
I think the thing that we've done a lot

1642
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:16,190
I think the thing that we've done a lot
 

1643
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,980
I think the thing that we've done a lot
I've done a lot it's just sort of

1644
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:17,990
I've done a lot it's just sort of
 

1645
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,080
I've done a lot it's just sort of
exhaustive search in the computational

find one that does something interesting
 

1653
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:27,970
find one that does something interesting
and useful for you um there's a lot of

1654
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:27,980
and useful for you um there's a lot of
 

1655
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,519
and useful for you um there's a lot of
things to say about what well actually

1656
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:30,529
things to say about what well actually
 

1657
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:32,259
things to say about what well actually
in in these search of trillion programs

1658
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:32,269
in in these search of trillion programs
 

1659
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:34,210
in in these search of trillion programs
and find one that's useful let me show

1660
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:34,220
and find one that's useful let me show
 

1661
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,810
and find one that's useful let me show
you another example of that um see so I

1662
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:37,820
you another example of that um see so I
 

1663
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:43,180
you another example of that um see so I
was interested a while ago in the I have

1664
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,190
was interested a while ago in the I have
 

1665
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:49,529
was interested a while ago in the I have
to look something up here sorry um in C

1666
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:49,539
to look something up here sorry um in C
 

1667
00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:56,470
to look something up here sorry um in C
in boolean algebra and in I was

1668
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:56,480
in boolean algebra and in I was
 

1669
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,029
in boolean algebra and in I was
interested in in the space of all

1670
00:33:58,029 --> 00:33:58,039
interested in in the space of all
 

1671
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:01,840
interested in in the space of all
possible mathematic says um and let me

1672
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:01,850
possible mathematic says um and let me
 

1673
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:07,090
possible mathematic says um and let me
just see here I I'm not finding what I

1674
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:07,100
just see here I I'm not finding what I
 

1675
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,569
just see here I I'm not finding what I
wanted to find sorry I was a good

1676
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:10,579
wanted to find sorry I was a good
 

1677
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:14,379
wanted to find sorry I was a good
example I should have memorized this but

1678
00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:14,389
example I should have memorized this but
 

1679
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:18,460
example I should have memorized this but
I haven't so um there we go there it is

1680
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:18,470
I haven't so um there we go there it is
 

1681
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:24,520
I haven't so um there we go there it is
um so I was interested in if you just

1682
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:24,530
um so I was interested in if you just
 

1683
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,260
um so I was interested in if you just
look at so we talked about sort of

1684
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:26,270
look at so we talked about sort of
 

1685
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:32,349
look at so we talked about sort of
looking at the space of all possible the

1686
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:32,359
looking at the space of all possible the
 

1687
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:34,359
looking at the space of all possible the
space of all possible programs another

1688
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:34,369
space of all possible programs another
 

1689
00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:35,800
space of all possible programs another
thing you can do is say if you're going

1690
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:35,810
thing you can do is say if you're going
 

1691
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:38,109
thing you can do is say if you're going
to invent mathematics from nothing what

1692
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:38,119
to invent mathematics from nothing what
 

1693
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,000
to invent mathematics from nothing what
possible axiom systems could be used in

1694
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,010
possible axiom systems could be used in
 

1695
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:43,180
possible axiom systems could be used in
mathematics so I was curious where do

1696
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:43,190
mathematics so I was curious where do
 

1697
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,010
mathematics so I was curious where do
and that again might seem like a

1698
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:45,020
and that again might seem like a
 

1699
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,379
and that again might seem like a
completely crazy thing to do to just say

1700
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:47,389
completely crazy thing to do to just say
 

1701
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:49,480
completely crazy thing to do to just say
let's just start enumerate axiom systems

1702
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:49,490
let's just start enumerate axiom systems
 

1703
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:50,980
let's just start enumerate axiom systems
at random and see if we find one that's

1704
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:50,990
at random and see if we find one that's
 

1705
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:54,220
at random and see if we find one that's
interesting and useful but it turns out

1706
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:54,230
interesting and useful but it turns out
 

1707
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,619
interesting and useful but it turns out
once you have this idea that out in the

1708
00:34:56,619 --> 00:34:56,629
once you have this idea that out in the
 

1709
00:34:56,629 --> 00:34:58,059
once you have this idea that out in the
computational universe or possible

1710
00:34:58,059 --> 00:34:58,069
computational universe or possible
 

1711
00:34:58,069 --> 00:34:59,890
computational universe or possible
programs there's actually a lot of

1712
00:34:59,890 --> 00:34:59,900
programs there's actually a lot of
 

1713
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,319
programs there's actually a lot of
low-hanging fruit to be found it turns

1714
00:35:02,319 --> 00:35:02,329
low-hanging fruit to be found it turns
 

1715
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:04,059
low-hanging fruit to be found it turns
out you can apply that in lots of places

1716
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:04,069
out you can apply that in lots of places
 

1717
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:05,650
out you can apply that in lots of places
I mean the thing to understand is why

1718
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:05,660
I mean the thing to understand is why
 

1719
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,420
I mean the thing to understand is why
why do we not see a lot of engineering

1720
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:07,430
why do we not see a lot of engineering
 

1721
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,099
why do we not see a lot of engineering
structures that look like this the

1722
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:09,109
structures that look like this the
 

1723
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:11,859
structures that look like this the
reason is because our traditional model

1724
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:11,869
reason is because our traditional model
 

1725
00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:13,930
reason is because our traditional model
of engineering has been we engineer

1726
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:13,940
of engineering has been we engineer
 

1727
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,700
of engineering has been we engineer
things in a way where we where we can

1728
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:15,710
things in a way where we where we can
 

1729
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,140
things in a way where we where we can
foresee what the outcome of our

1730
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:17,150
foresee what the outcome of our
 

1731
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,270
foresee what the outcome of our
engineering steps are going to be and

1732
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:19,280
engineering steps are going to be and
 

1733
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,370
engineering steps are going to be and
when it comes to something like this we

1734
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:21,380
when it comes to something like this we
 

1735
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,020
when it comes to something like this we
can find it out in the computational

1736
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:23,030
can find it out in the computational
 

1737
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,970
can find it out in the computational
universe what we can't readily foresee

1738
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:24,980
universe what we can't readily foresee
 

1739
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,410
universe what we can't readily foresee
what's going to happen we can't do sort

1740
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:26,420
what's going to happen we can't do sort
 

1741
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,360
what's going to happen we can't do sort
of a step by step design

1742
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:28,370
of a step by step design
 

1743
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,280
of a step by step design
of this particular thing and so in

1744
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:30,290
of this particular thing and so in
 

1745
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,870
of this particular thing and so in
engineering and human engineering as

1746
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:31,880
engineering and human engineering as
 

1747
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,450
engineering and human engineering as
it's been practiced so far most of it

1748
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:34,460
it's been practiced so far most of it
 

1749
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,790
it's been practiced so far most of it
has consisted of building things where

1750
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:36,800
has consisted of building things where
 

1751
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,070
has consisted of building things where
we can foresee step by step what the

1752
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:39,080
we can foresee step by step what the
 

1753
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,450
we can foresee step by step what the
outcome of our engineering going to be

1754
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:40,460
outcome of our engineering going to be
 

1755
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,400
outcome of our engineering going to be
and we see that in programs we see that

1756
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:42,410
and we see that in programs we see that
 

1757
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:45,100
and we see that in programs we see that
in other kinds of engineering structures

1758
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:45,110
in other kinds of engineering structures
 

1759
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,660
in other kinds of engineering structures
and so there's sort of a different kind

1760
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:46,670
and so there's sort of a different kind
 

1761
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,400
and so there's sort of a different kind
of engineering which is about mining the

1762
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:48,410
of engineering which is about mining the
 

1763
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:50,320
of engineering which is about mining the
computational universe of possible

1764
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:50,330
computational universe of possible
 

1765
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,820
computational universe of possible
programs and it's worth realizing

1766
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:51,830
programs and it's worth realizing
 

1767
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:54,070
programs and it's worth realizing
there's a lot more that can be done a

1768
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:54,080
there's a lot more that can be done a
 

1769
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,020
there's a lot more that can be done a
lot more efficiently by mining the

1770
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:56,030
lot more efficiently by mining the
 

1771
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,400
lot more efficiently by mining the
computational universe of possible

1772
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:57,410
computational universe of possible
 

1773
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:59,290
computational universe of possible
programs than by just constructing

1774
00:35:59,290 --> 00:35:59,300
programs than by just constructing
 

1775
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,150
programs than by just constructing
things step by step as a human so for

1776
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:01,160
things step by step as a human so for
 

1777
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,470
things step by step as a human so for
example if you look for optimal

1778
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:02,480
example if you look for optimal
 

1779
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,420
example if you look for optimal
algorithms for things like I don't know

1780
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:04,430
algorithms for things like I don't know
 

1781
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,640
algorithms for things like I don't know
even something like sorting networks the

1782
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:06,650
even something like sorting networks the
 

1783
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:09,010
even something like sorting networks the
optimal sorting networks look very

1784
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:09,020
optimal sorting networks look very
 

1785
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,480
optimal sorting networks look very
complicated they're not things that you

1786
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:10,490
complicated they're not things that you
 

1787
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:13,890
complicated they're not things that you
would construct by sort of step-by-step

1788
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:13,900
would construct by sort of step-by-step
 

1789
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,870
would construct by sort of step-by-step
thinking about things with in a kind of

1790
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:16,880
thinking about things with in a kind of
 

1791
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,310
thinking about things with in a kind of
in a kind of typical human way and so

1792
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:21,320
in a kind of typical human way and so
 

1793
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,470
in a kind of typical human way and so
this this idea you know if you're really

1794
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:23,480
this this idea you know if you're really
 

1795
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,790
this this idea you know if you're really
going to have computation work

1796
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:24,800
going to have computation work
 

1797
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,190
going to have computation work
efficiently you are going to end up with

1798
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:27,200
efficiently you are going to end up with
 

1799
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,050
efficiently you are going to end up with
these programs that are sort of just

1800
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:29,060
these programs that are sort of just
 

1801
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,790
these programs that are sort of just
mined from the computational universe

1802
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:30,800
mined from the computational universe
 

1803
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,580
mined from the computational universe
and one of the issues with mining things

1804
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:33,590
and one of the issues with mining things
 

1805
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,590
and one of the issues with mining things
so they're there this makes use of

1806
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:35,600
so they're there this makes use of
 

1807
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,410
so they're there this makes use of
computation much more efficiently than a

1808
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:38,420
computation much more efficiently than a
 

1809
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,150
computation much more efficiently than a
typical thing that we might construct

1810
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:40,160
typical thing that we might construct
 

1811
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,070
typical thing that we might construct
now one feature of this is it's hard to

1812
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:42,080
now one feature of this is it's hard to
 

1813
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,870
now one feature of this is it's hard to
understand what's going on and there's

1814
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:43,880
understand what's going on and there's
 

1815
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,340
understand what's going on and there's
actually a fundamental reason for that

1816
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:45,350
actually a fundamental reason for that
 

1817
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,290
actually a fundamental reason for that
which is in our efforts to sort of

1818
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:47,300
which is in our efforts to sort of
 

1819
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,210
which is in our efforts to sort of
understand what's going on we get to use

1820
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:49,220
understand what's going on we get to use
 

1821
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,790
understand what's going on we get to use
our brains our computers our mathematics

particular little program did a certain

1826
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:56,750
particular little program did a certain
 

1827
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,120
particular little program did a certain
amount of computation to work out this

1828
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:58,130
amount of computation to work out this
 

1829
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,640
amount of computation to work out this
pattern the question is can we kind of

1830
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:00,650
pattern the question is can we kind of
 

1831
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:03,730
pattern the question is can we kind of
outrun that computation and say oh I can

1832
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:03,740
outrun that computation and say oh I can
 

1833
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,500
outrun that computation and say oh I can
tell that actually this particular bit

1834
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:05,510
tell that actually this particular bit
 

1835
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,630
tell that actually this particular bit
down here is going to be a black black

1836
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:07,640
down here is going to be a black black
 

1837
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,090
down here is going to be a black black
bit you don't have to go and do all that

1838
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:10,100
bit you don't have to go and do all that
 

1839
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,240
bit you don't have to go and do all that
computation but it turns out that then

1840
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:13,250
computation but it turns out that then
 

1841
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:15,010
computation but it turns out that then
again this will maybe as a digression

1842
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:15,020
again this will maybe as a digression
 

1843
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,350
again this will maybe as a digression
which which there's this phenomenon I

00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:17,360
which which there's this phenomenon I
 

1845
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,750
which which there's this phenomenon I
call computational irreducibility which

1846
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:19,760
call computational irreducibility which
 

1847
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,460
call computational irreducibility which

happen so back to mathematics for a
 

1915
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,670
happen so back to mathematics for a
second so this is just an axiom system

1916
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:30,680
second so this is just an axiom system
 

1917
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,370
second so this is just an axiom system
that so I looked for all possible look

1918
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:34,380
that so I looked for all possible look
 

1919
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,140
that so I looked for all possible look
through sort of all possible axiom

1920
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:36,150
through sort of all possible axiom
 

1921
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,300
through sort of all possible axiom
systems starting off with very really

00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:38,310
systems starting off with very really
 

1923
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,290
systems starting off with very really
tiny ones and I asked the question

1924
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:39,300
tiny ones and I asked the question
 

1925
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,290
tiny ones and I asked the question
what's the first axiom system that

1926
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:42,300
what's the first axiom system that
 

1927
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,750
what's the first axiom system that
corresponds to boolean algebra so it

1928
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:44,760
corresponds to boolean algebra so it
 

1929
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,730
corresponds to boolean algebra so it
turns out this this thing here this tiny

1930
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:46,740
turns out this this thing here this tiny
 

1931
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,640
turns out this this thing here this tiny
little thing here generates all theorems

1932
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:49,650
little thing here generates all theorems
 

1933
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,140
little thing here generates all theorems
of boolean algebra it is that it is the

1934
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:51,150
of boolean algebra it is that it is the
 

1935
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:53,599
of boolean algebra it is that it is the
simplest axiom for boolean algebra now

1936
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:53,609
simplest axiom for boolean algebra now
 

1937
00:38:53,609 --> 00:38:55,040

00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:57,030
because it's a new feature you see they
 

1941
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:01,550
because it's a new feature you see they
um if I say find equation or proof let's

1942
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:01,560
um if I say find equation or proof let's
 

1943
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,040
um if I say find equation or proof let's
say I want to prove commutativity of the

something here this is going to try to

1948
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:08,160
something here this is going to try to
 

1949
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,329
something here this is going to try to
generate let's see if this works this is

1950
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:11,339
generate let's see if this works this is
 

1951
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:13,250
generate let's see if this works this is
going to try to generate an automated

1952
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:13,260
going to try to generate an automated
 

1953
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,520
going to try to generate an automated
proof based on that axiom system of that

1954
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:16,530
proof based on that axiom system of that
 

1955
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,800
proof based on that axiom system of that
result so it had 102 steps in the proof

1956
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:18,810
result so it had 102 steps in the proof
 

1957
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:22,550
result so it had 102 steps in the proof
and let's try and say let's look at for

1958
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:22,560
and let's try and say let's look at for
 

1959
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,829
and let's try and say let's look at for
example the proof network here actually

1960
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:24,839
example the proof network here actually
 

1961
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:27,559
example the proof network here actually
let's look at the proof data set um now

1962
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:27,569
let's look at the proof data set um now
 

1963
00:39:27,569 --> 00:39:30,349
let's look at the proof data set um now
that's not what I wanted I should learn

1964
00:39:30,349 --> 00:39:30,359
that's not what I wanted I should learn
 

1965
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:37,280
that's not what I wanted I should learn
how to use this shouldn't I um let's see

1966
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:37,290
how to use this shouldn't I um let's see
 

1967
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:42,230
how to use this shouldn't I um let's see
what I want is the you know proof data

1968
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:42,240
what I want is the you know proof data
 

1969
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:47,089
what I want is the you know proof data
set there we go very good ok so this is

1970
00:39:47,089 --> 00:39:47,099
set there we go very good ok so this is
 

1971
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:49,670
set there we go very good ok so this is
actually let's let's say first of all

1972
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:49,680
actually let's let's say first of all
 

1973
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,309
actually let's let's say first of all
let's say the proof graph ok so this is

1974
00:39:52,309 --> 00:39:52,319
let's say the proof graph ok so this is
 

1975
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:54,950
let's say the proof graph ok so this is
going to show me the how that proof was

1976
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:54,960
going to show me the how that proof was
 

1977
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,910
going to show me the how that proof was
done so

1978
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:55,920
done so
 

1979
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,559
done so
they're a bunch of lemmas that got

1980
00:39:57,559 --> 00:39:57,569
they're a bunch of lemmas that got
 

1981
00:39:57,569 --> 00:39:59,780
they're a bunch of lemmas that got
proved and from those lemmas those

1982
00:39:59,780 --> 00:39:59,790
proved and from those lemmas those
 

1983
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:01,430
proved and from those lemmas those
lemmas were combined and eventually it

1984
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:01,440
lemmas were combined and eventually it
 

1985
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,650
lemmas were combined and eventually it
proved the result so let's let's take a

1986
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:03,660
proved the result so let's let's take a
 

1987
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,880
proved the result so let's let's take a
look at the let's take a look at what

1988
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:04,890
look at the let's take a look at what
 

1989
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:09,230
look at the let's take a look at what
some of those llamas were okay so here's

1990
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:09,240
some of those llamas were okay so here's
 

1991
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,900
some of those llamas were okay so here's
the results so after so it goes through

1992
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:11,910
the results so after so it goes through
 

1993
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,819
the results so after so it goes through
and these are various lemmas it's using

1994
00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:13,829
and these are various lemmas it's using
 

1995
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:15,829
and these are various lemmas it's using
and eventually after many pages of

1996
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:15,839
and eventually after many pages of
 

1997
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,859
and eventually after many pages of
nonsense it will get to the result okay

1998
00:40:18,859 --> 00:40:18,869
nonsense it will get to the result okay
 

1999
00:40:18,869 --> 00:40:20,420
nonsense it will get to the result okay
each one of these some of these llamas

2000
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:20,430
each one of these some of these llamas
 

2001
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,280
each one of these some of these llamas
are kind of complicated there that's

2002
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:22,290
are kind of complicated there that's
 

2003
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:23,870
are kind of complicated there that's
that's that llama it's a pretty

2004
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:23,880
that's that llama it's a pretty
 

2005
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,910
that's that llama it's a pretty
complicated lemma etc etcetera etcetera

2006
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:25,920
complicated lemma etc etcetera etcetera
 

2007
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,530
complicated lemma etc etcetera etcetera
so you might ask what on earth is going

2008
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:27,540
so you might ask what on earth is going
 

2009
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,349
so you might ask what on earth is going
on here and the answer is so I first

2010
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:30,359
on here and the answer is so I first
 

2011
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:31,760
on here and the answer is so I first
generated a version of this proof 20

2012
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:31,770
generated a version of this proof 20
 

2013
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,710
generated a version of this proof 20
years ago and I tried to understand what

2014
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:33,720
years ago and I tried to understand what
 

2015
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,569
years ago and I tried to understand what
was going on and I completely failed and

2016
00:40:35,569 --> 00:40:35,579
was going on and I completely failed and
 

2017
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:38,089
was going on and I completely failed and
it's sort of embarrassing because this

2018
00:40:38,089 --> 00:40:38,099
it's sort of embarrassing because this
 

2019
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:39,740
it's sort of embarrassing because this
is supposed to be a proof it's supposed

2020
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:39,750
is supposed to be a proof it's supposed
 

2021
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,990
is supposed to be a proof it's supposed
to be you know demonstrating some

2022
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:42,000
to be you know demonstrating some
 

2023
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,720
to be you know demonstrating some
results and what we realize is that you

2024
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:44,730
results and what we realize is that you
 

2025
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,520
results and what we realize is that you
know what does it mean to have a proof

2026
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:46,530
know what does it mean to have a proof
 

2027
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,720
know what does it mean to have a proof
of something what does it mean to

2028
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:47,730
of something what does it mean to
 

2029
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:50,480
of something what does it mean to
explain how a thing is done you know

2030
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:50,490
explain how a thing is done you know
 

2031
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,309
explain how a thing is done you know
what is the purpose of a proof purpose

2032
00:40:52,309 --> 00:40:52,319
what is the purpose of a proof purpose
 

2033
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,230
what is the purpose of a proof purpose
of a proof is basically to let humans

2034
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:54,240
of a proof is basically to let humans
 

2035
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,990
of a proof is basically to let humans
understand why something is true and so

2036
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:57,000
understand why something is true and so
 

2037
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,740
understand why something is true and so
for example if you go to let's say we go

2038
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:00,750
for example if you go to let's say we go
 

2039
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,410
for example if you go to let's say we go
to wolf now fur and we do you know some

2040
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:03,420
to wolf now fur and we do you know some
 

2041
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,140
to wolf now fur and we do you know some
random thing where we say let's do you

2042
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:06,150
random thing where we say let's do you
 

2043
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,059
random thing where we say let's do you
know an integral of something or another

2044
00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:08,069
know an integral of something or another
 

2045
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:10,940
know an integral of something or another
it will be able to very quickly in fact

2046
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:10,950
it will be able to very quickly in fact
 

2047
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,230
it will be able to very quickly in fact
it will take it only milliseconds

2048
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:12,240
it will take it only milliseconds
 

2049
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,120
it will take it only milliseconds
internally to work out the answer to

2050
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,130
internally to work out the answer to
 

2051
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,190
internally to work out the answer to
that integral okay but then somebody

2052
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:16,200
that integral okay but then somebody
 

2053
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,900
that integral okay but then somebody
whose wants to hand in a piece of

whose wants to hand in a piece of
 

2055
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,849
whose wants to hand in a piece of
homework or something like that needs to

00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:19,859
homework or something like that needs to
 

2057
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:23,750
homework or something like that needs to
explain why is this true okay well we

2058
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:23,760
explain why is this true okay well we
 

2059
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,349
explain why is this true okay well we
have this handy step-by-step solution

2060
00:41:26,349 --> 00:41:26,359
have this handy step-by-step solution
 

2061
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:30,200
have this handy step-by-step solution
thing here which

2062
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:30,210
thing here which
 

2063
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:33,060
thing here which
explains why it's true now the thing I

2064
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,070
explains why it's true now the thing I
 

2065
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,830
explains why it's true now the thing I
should admit about the step-by-step

2066
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:34,840
should admit about the step-by-step
 

2067
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,470
should admit about the step-by-step
solution is it's completely fake that is

2068
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:37,480
solution is it's completely fake that is
 

2069
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,480
solution is it's completely fake that is
the steps that are described in the step

2070
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:39,490
the steps that are described in the step
 

2071
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:41,130
the steps that are described in the step
by step solution have absolutely nothing

2072
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:41,140
by step solution have absolutely nothing
 

2073
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,109
by step solution have absolutely nothing
to do with the way that internally that

2074
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:43,119
to do with the way that internally that
 

2075
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,180
to do with the way that internally that
integral was computed these are steps

2076
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:45,190
integral was computed these are steps
 

2077
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:47,070
integral was computed these are steps
created purely for the purpose of

2078
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:47,080
created purely for the purpose of
 

2079
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,890
created purely for the purpose of
telling a story to humans about why this

2080
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:49,900
telling a story to humans about why this
 

2081
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,320
telling a story to humans about why this
integral came out the way it did and now

2082
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:52,330
integral came out the way it did and now
 

2083
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:54,540
integral came out the way it did and now
what we're seeing and so that's a so

2084
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:54,550
what we're seeing and so that's a so
 

2085
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,980
what we're seeing and so that's a so
that's one thing is knowing the answer

2086
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:55,990
that's one thing is knowing the answer
 

2087
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,240
that's one thing is knowing the answer
the other thing is being able to tell a

2088
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:57,250
the other thing is being able to tell a
 

2089
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,890
the other thing is being able to tell a
story about why the answer worked that

2090
00:41:58,890 --> 00:41:58,900
story about why the answer worked that
 

2091
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,280
story about why the answer worked that
way

2092
00:41:59,280 --> 00:41:59,290
way
 

2093
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:02,100
way
well what we see here is this is a proof

2094
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:02,110
well what we see here is this is a proof
 

2095
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:04,380
well what we see here is this is a proof
but it was an automatically generated

2096
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:04,390
but it was an automatically generated
 

2097
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,930
but it was an automatically generated
proof and it's a really lousy story for

2098
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:06,940
proof and it's a really lousy story for
 

2099
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,150
proof and it's a really lousy story for
us humans I mean if it turned out that

2100
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:09,160
us humans I mean if it turned out that
 

2101
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,130
us humans I mean if it turned out that
one of these theorems here was one that

2102
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:11,140
one of these theorems here was one that
 

2103
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,050
one of these theorems here was one that
had been proved by Gauss or something

2104
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:13,060
had been proved by Gauss or something
 

2105
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,480
had been proved by Gauss or something
and appeared in all the textbooks we

2106
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:15,490
and appeared in all the textbooks we
 

2107
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:16,859
and appeared in all the textbooks we
would be much happier because then we

2108
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:16,869
would be much happier because then we
 

2109
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:18,830
would be much happier because then we
would start to have a kind of human

2110
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:18,840
would start to have a kind of human
 

2111
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,180
would start to have a kind of human
representable story about what was going

2112
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:21,190
representable story about what was going
 

2113
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,440
representable story about what was going
on instead we just get a bunch of

2114
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:22,450
on instead we just get a bunch of
 

2115
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:24,510
on instead we just get a bunch of
machine generated lemmas that we can't

2116
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:24,520
machine generated lemmas that we can't
 

2117
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,770
machine generated lemmas that we can't
understand that we can't kind of wrap

2118
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:25,780
understand that we can't kind of wrap
 

2119
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,840
understand that we can't kind of wrap
our brains around and it's sort of the

2120
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:27,850
our brains around and it's sort of the
 

2121
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:31,170
our brains around and it's sort of the
same thing that's going on in when we

2122
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:31,180
same thing that's going on in when we
 

2123
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,030
same thing that's going on in when we
look at when these neural nets we're

2124
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:33,040
look at when these neural nets we're
 

2125
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,230
look at when these neural nets we're
seeing you know when we were looking

2126
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:34,240
seeing you know when we were looking
 

2127
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,359
seeing you know when we were looking
wherever it was at the innards of that

2128
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:36,369
wherever it was at the innards of that
 

2129
00:42:36,369 --> 00:42:38,580
wherever it was at the innards of that
neuron that and we say well how is it

2130
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:38,590
neuron that and we say well how is it
 

2131
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,050
neuron that and we say well how is it
figuring out that that's a picture of a

2132
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:40,060
figuring out that that's a picture of a
 

2133
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,570
figuring out that that's a picture of a
panda well the answer is it decided that

2134
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:42,580
panda well the answer is it decided that
 

2135
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:45,240
panda well the answer is it decided that
you know if we humans were saying how

2136
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:45,250
you know if we humans were saying how
 

2137
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,349
you know if we humans were saying how
would you figure out if it's a picture

2138
00:42:46,349 --> 00:42:46,359
would you figure out if it's a picture
 

2139
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:48,900
would you figure out if it's a picture
of panda we might say well look and see

2140
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:48,910
of panda we might say well look and see
 

2141
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:50,880
of panda we might say well look and see
if it has eyes that's a clue for whether

2142
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:50,890
if it has eyes that's a clue for whether
 

2143
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:52,230
if it has eyes that's a clue for whether
it's an animal look and see if it's

2144
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:52,240
it's an animal look and see if it's
 

2145
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,180
it's an animal look and see if it's
looks like it's kind of round and furry

2146
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:54,190
looks like it's kind of round and furry
 

2147
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:56,430
looks like it's kind of round and furry
and things that's a version of whether

2148
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:56,440
and things that's a version of whether
 

2149
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,200
and things that's a version of whether
it's a panda and Len cetera etcetera

2150
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:58,210
it's a panda and Len cetera etcetera
 

2151
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:00,599
it's a panda and Len cetera etcetera
etcetera but what it's doing is it

2152
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:00,609
etcetera but what it's doing is it
 

2153
00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:03,090
etcetera but what it's doing is it
learnt a bunch of criteria for you know

2154
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:03,100
learnt a bunch of criteria for you know
 

2155
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,859
learnt a bunch of criteria for you know
is it a panda or is it one of 10,000

2156
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:04,869
is it a panda or is it one of 10,000
 

2157
00:43:04,869 --> 00:43:06,060
is it a panda or is it one of 10,000
other possible things that it could have

2158
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:06,070
other possible things that it could have
 

2159
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:08,580
other possible things that it could have
recognized and it learnt those criteria

2160
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:08,590
recognized and it learnt those criteria
 

2161
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:11,670
recognized and it learnt those criteria
in a way that was somehow optimal based

2162
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:11,680
in a way that was somehow optimal based
 

2163
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,200
in a way that was somehow optimal based
on the training that it got and so on

2164
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:13,210
on the training that it got and so on
 

2165
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:14,700
on the training that it got and so on
but it learnt things which were

2166
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:14,710
but it learnt things which were
 

2167
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:16,140
but it learnt things which were
distinctions which are different from

2168
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:16,150
distinctions which are different from
 

2169
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:18,540
distinctions which are different from
the distinctions that we humans make in

2170
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:18,550
the distinctions that we humans make in
 

2171
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:20,940
the distinctions that we humans make in
the language that we as humans use and

2172
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:20,950
the language that we as humans use and
 

2173
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:23,849
the language that we as humans use and
so in some sense you know when we start

2174
00:43:23,849 --> 00:43:23,859
so in some sense you know when we start
 

2175
00:43:23,859 --> 00:43:26,160
so in some sense you know when we start
talking about will describe a picture we

2176
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:26,170
talking about will describe a picture we
 

2177
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,630
talking about will describe a picture we
have a certain human language for

2178
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:27,640
have a certain human language for
 

2179
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,550
have a certain human language for
describing that picture we have you know

2180
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:29,560
describing that picture we have you know
 

2181
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,650
describing that picture we have you know
in our human in typical human languages

2182
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:31,660
in our human in typical human languages
 

2183
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,599
in our human in typical human languages
we have maybe thirty to fifty thousand

2184
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:33,609
we have maybe thirty to fifty thousand
 

2185
00:43:33,609 --> 00:43:35,310
we have maybe thirty to fifty thousand
words that we use to describe things

2186
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:35,320
words that we use to describe things
 

2187
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,650
words that we use to describe things
those words are words that have sort of

2188
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:37,660
those words are words that have sort of
 

2189
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:40,109
those words are words that have sort of
evolved as being useful for describing

2190
00:43:40,109 --> 00:43:40,119
evolved as being useful for describing
 

2191
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:41,840
evolved as being useful for describing
the world that we live in

2192
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:41,850
the world that we live in
 

2193
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:44,060
the world that we live in
um when it comes to there's known that

2194
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:44,070
um when it comes to there's known that
 

2195
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:48,050
um when it comes to there's known that
it could be using it could say well that

2196
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:48,060
it could be using it could say well that
 

2197
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,940
it could be using it could say well that
the words that it is effectively learnt

2198
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:49,950
the words that it is effectively learnt
 

2199
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:52,250
the words that it is effectively learnt
which allow it to make distinctions

2200
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:52,260
which allow it to make distinctions
 

2201
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,470
which allow it to make distinctions
about what's going on in the in the

2202
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:54,480
about what's going on in the in the
 

2203
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,720
about what's going on in the in the
analysis that it's doing it has

2204
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:56,730
analysis that it's doing it has
 

2205
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:59,810
analysis that it's doing it has
effectively invented words that describe

2206
00:43:59,810 --> 00:43:59,820
effectively invented words that describe
 

2207
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,670
effectively invented words that describe
distinctions but those words have

2208
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:01,680
distinctions but those words have
 

2209
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,230
distinctions but those words have
nothing to do with our historically

2210
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:03,240
nothing to do with our historically
 

2211
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,240
nothing to do with our historically
invented words that exist in our

2212
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:05,250
invented words that exist in our
 

2213
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:06,890
invented words that exist in our
languages so it's kind of an interesting

2214
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:06,900
languages so it's kind of an interesting
 

2215
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,860
languages so it's kind of an interesting
situation that that it is its way of

2216
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:09,870
situation that that it is its way of
 

2217
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:11,240
situation that that it is its way of
thinking so to speak if you say well

2218
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:11,250
thinking so to speak if you say well
 

2219
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,530
thinking so to speak if you say well
what's it thinking about how do we

2220
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:12,540
what's it thinking about how do we
 

2221
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,390
what's it thinking about how do we
describe what it's thinking that's a

2222
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:14,400
describe what it's thinking that's a
 

2223
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,700
describe what it's thinking that's a
tough thing to answer because just like

2224
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:16,710
tough thing to answer because just like
 

2225
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:18,530
tough thing to answer because just like
with the with the automated theorem

2226
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:18,540
with the with the automated theorem
 

2227
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:22,400
with the with the automated theorem
we're we're sort of stuck having to say

2228
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:22,410
we're we're sort of stuck having to say
 

2229
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:25,190
we're we're sort of stuck having to say
well we can't really tell a human story

2230
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:25,200
well we can't really tell a human story
 

2231
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,350
well we can't really tell a human story
because the things that it invented are

2232
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:27,360
because the things that it invented are
 

2233
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,580
because the things that it invented are
things for which we don't even have

2234
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:28,590
things for which we don't even have
 

2235
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:31,460
things for which we don't even have
words in our languages and so on okay so

2236
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:31,470
words in our languages and so on okay so
 

2237
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:35,180
words in our languages and so on okay so
one thing to realize is in this kind of

2238
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:35,190
one thing to realize is in this kind of
 

2239
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:37,460
one thing to realize is in this kind of
space of sort of all possible

2240
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:37,470
space of sort of all possible
 

2241
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:39,410
space of sort of all possible
computations there's a lot of stuff out

2242
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:39,420
computations there's a lot of stuff out
 

2243
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,690
computations there's a lot of stuff out
there that can be done there's this kind

2244
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:41,700
there that can be done there's this kind
 

2245
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,120
there that can be done there's this kind
of ocean of sophisticated computation

2246
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:44,130
of ocean of sophisticated computation
 

2247
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:47,330
of ocean of sophisticated computation
and then the question that we have to

2248
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:47,340
and then the question that we have to
 

2249
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:51,140
and then the question that we have to
ask for us humans is okay how do we make

2250
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:51,150
ask for us humans is okay how do we make
 

2251
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:53,900
ask for us humans is okay how do we make
use of all of that stuff so what we've

2252
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:53,910
use of all of that stuff so what we've
 

2253
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:55,910
use of all of that stuff so what we've
got kind of on the one hand is we've got

2254
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:55,920
got kind of on the one hand is we've got
 

2255
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,890
got kind of on the one hand is we've got
the things we know how to think about

2256
00:44:57,890 --> 00:44:57,900
the things we know how to think about
 

2257
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,920
the things we know how to think about
human language is our way of describing

2258
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:00,930
human language is our way of describing
 

2259
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:02,690
human language is our way of describing
things our way of talking about stuff

2260
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:02,700
things our way of talking about stuff
 

2261
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,850
things our way of talking about stuff
that's the one one set of things the

2262
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:04,860
that's the one one set of things the
 

2263
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,620
that's the one one set of things the
other set of things we have is this very

2264
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:06,630
other set of things we have is this very
 

2265
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:08,570
other set of things we have is this very
powerful kind of seething ocean of

2266
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:08,580
powerful kind of seething ocean of
 

2267
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,490
powerful kind of seething ocean of
computation on the other side where lots

2268
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:10,500
computation on the other side where lots
 

2269
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,650
computation on the other side where lots
of things can happen so the question is

2270
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:12,660
of things can happen so the question is
 

2271
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,600
of things can happen so the question is
how do we make use of this sort of ocean

2272
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:14,610
how do we make use of this sort of ocean
 

2273
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:16,640
how do we make use of this sort of ocean
of computation in the best possible way

2274
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:16,650
of computation in the best possible way
 

2275
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:18,800
of computation in the best possible way
for our human purposes and building

2276
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:18,810
for our human purposes and building
 

2277
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:22,010
for our human purposes and building
technology and so on and so the the way

2278
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:22,020
technology and so on and so the the way
 

2279
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:26,450
technology and so on and so the the way
I see you know my kind of part of what

2280
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:26,460
I see you know my kind of part of what
 

2281
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,160
I see you know my kind of part of what
I've spent a very long time doing is

2282
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:28,170
I've spent a very long time doing is
 

2283
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:30,260
I've spent a very long time doing is
kind of building a language that allows

2284
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:30,270
kind of building a language that allows
 

2285
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:32,480
kind of building a language that allows
us to take human thinking on the one

2286
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:32,490
us to take human thinking on the one
 

2287
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:36,890
us to take human thinking on the one
hand and describe and sort of provide a

2288
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:36,900
hand and describe and sort of provide a
 

2289
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,840
hand and describe and sort of provide a
sort of computational communication

2290
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:38,850
sort of computational communication
 

2291
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:41,300
sort of computational communication
language that allows us to get the

2292
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:41,310
language that allows us to get the
 

2293
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:42,920
language that allows us to get the
benefit of what's possible over in the

2294
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:42,930
benefit of what's possible over in the
 

2295
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:45,530
benefit of what's possible over in the
sort of ocean of computation in a way

2296
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:45,540
sort of ocean of computation in a way
 

2297
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,380
sort of ocean of computation in a way
that's rooted in what we humans actually

2298
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:48,390
that's rooted in what we humans actually
 

2299
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:51,020
that's rooted in what we humans actually
want to do and so I kind of view both

2300
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:51,030
want to do and so I kind of view both
 

2301
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:53,060
want to do and so I kind of view both
from language as being sort of an

2302
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:53,070
from language as being sort of an
 

2303
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:55,880
from language as being sort of an
attempt to make a bridge between so you

2304
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:55,890
attempt to make a bridge between so you
 

2305
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:57,470
attempt to make a bridge between so you
on the one hand there's all possible

2306
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:57,480
on the one hand there's all possible
 

2307
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,599
on the one hand there's all possible
computations on the other hand there's

2308
00:45:59,599 --> 00:45:59,609
computations on the other hand there's
 

2309
00:45:59,609 --> 00:46:02,839
computations on the other hand there's
things we think we want to do and I view

2310
00:46:02,839 --> 00:46:02,849
things we think we want to do and I view
 

2311
00:46:02,849 --> 00:46:05,239
things we think we want to do and I view
or from language as being my best

2312
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:05,249
or from language as being my best
 

2313
00:46:05,249 --> 00:46:08,620
or from language as being my best
attempt right now to make a way to take

2314
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:08,630
attempt right now to make a way to take
 

2315
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:11,390
attempt right now to make a way to take
our sort of human computational thinking

2316
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:11,400
our sort of human computational thinking
 

2317
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,690
our sort of human computational thinking
and be able to actually implement it so

2318
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:14,700
and be able to actually implement it so
 

2319
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,299
and be able to actually implement it so
in a sense it's a language which works

2320
00:46:17,299 --> 00:46:17,309
in a sense it's a language which works
 

2321
00:46:17,309 --> 00:46:19,579
in a sense it's a language which works
in two on two sides it's both a language

2322
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:19,589
in two on two sides it's both a language
 

2323
00:46:19,589 --> 00:46:26,089
in two on two sides it's both a language
where you as a as a the machine can

2324
00:46:26,089 --> 00:46:26,099
where you as a as a the machine can
 

2325
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:27,920
where you as a as a the machine can
understand okay it's it's looking at

2326
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:27,930
understand okay it's it's looking at
 

2327
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:29,269
understand okay it's it's looking at
this and that's what it's going to

2328
00:46:29,269 --> 00:46:29,279
this and that's what it's going to
 

2329
00:46:29,279 --> 00:46:30,950
this and that's what it's going to
compute but on the other hand it's also

2330
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:30,960
compute but on the other hand it's also
 

2331
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,859
compute but on the other hand it's also
a language for us humans to think about

2332
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:33,869
a language for us humans to think about
 

2333
00:46:33,869 --> 00:46:35,779
a language for us humans to think about
things in computational terms so you

2334
00:46:35,779 --> 00:46:35,789
things in computational terms so you
 

2335
00:46:35,789 --> 00:46:37,910
things in computational terms so you
know if I go and I don't know one of

2336
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:37,920
know if I go and I don't know one of
 

2337
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,680
know if I go and I don't know one of
these one of these things that I'm doing

2338
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:39,690
these one of these things that I'm doing
 

2339
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:41,900
these one of these things that I'm doing
here whatever it is that this wasn't

2340
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:41,910
here whatever it is that this wasn't
 

2341
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:44,120
here whatever it is that this wasn't
that exciting but but you know fine

2342
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:44,130
that exciting but but you know fine
 

2343
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:47,059
that exciting but but you know fine
shortest tour of the Geo position of the

2344
00:46:47,059 --> 00:46:47,069
shortest tour of the Geo position of the
 

2345
00:46:47,069 --> 00:46:49,489
shortest tour of the Geo position of the
capital cities in South America that is

2346
00:46:49,489 --> 00:46:49,499
capital cities in South America that is
 

2347
00:46:49,499 --> 00:46:51,890
capital cities in South America that is
a language that's a representation in a

2348
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:51,900
a language that's a representation in a
 

2349
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,319
a language that's a representation in a
precise language of something and the

2350
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:54,329
precise language of something and the
 

2351
00:46:54,329 --> 00:46:56,930
precise language of something and the
idea is that that's a language which we

2352
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:56,940
idea is that that's a language which we
 

2353
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,989
idea is that that's a language which we
humans can find useful in thinking about

2354
00:46:59,989 --> 00:46:59,999
humans can find useful in thinking about
 

2355
00:46:59,999 --> 00:47:02,359
humans can find useful in thinking about
things in computational terms it also

2356
00:47:02,359 --> 00:47:02,369
things in computational terms it also
 

2357
00:47:02,369 --> 00:47:03,829
things in computational terms it also
happens to be a language that the

2358
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:03,839
happens to be a language that the
 

2359
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,420
happens to be a language that the
machine can immediately understand and

2360
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:05,430
machine can immediately understand and
 

2361
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:07,880
machine can immediately understand and
execute and so I think this is sort of a

2362
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:07,890
execute and so I think this is sort of a
 

2363
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:09,769
execute and so I think this is sort of a
general you know when I think about AI

2364
00:47:09,769 --> 00:47:09,779
general you know when I think about AI
 

2365
00:47:09,779 --> 00:47:13,160
general you know when I think about AI
in general the you know what is the sort

2366
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:13,170
in general the you know what is the sort
 

2367
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:15,019
in general the you know what is the sort
of what's the overall problem well part

2368
00:47:15,019 --> 00:47:15,029
of what's the overall problem well part
 

2369
00:47:15,029 --> 00:47:16,910
of what's the overall problem well part
of the overall problem is so how do we

2370
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:16,920
of the overall problem is so how do we
 

2371
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,890
of the overall problem is so how do we
tell the AI is what to do so to speak

2372
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:18,900
tell the AI is what to do so to speak
 

2373
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,529
tell the AI is what to do so to speak
there's this very powerful you know this

2374
00:47:21,529 --> 00:47:21,539
there's this very powerful you know this
 

2375
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:23,089
there's this very powerful you know this
sort of ocean of computation is what we

2376
00:47:23,089 --> 00:47:23,099
sort of ocean of computation is what we
 

2377
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:25,940
sort of ocean of computation is what we
get to mine for purposes of building AI

2378
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:25,950
get to mine for purposes of building AI
 

2379
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:28,370
get to mine for purposes of building AI
kinds of things but then the question is

2380
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:28,380
kinds of things but then the question is
 

2381
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,489
kinds of things but then the question is
how do we tell the AI is what to do and

2382
00:47:30,489 --> 00:47:30,499
how do we tell the AI is what to do and
 

2383
00:47:30,499 --> 00:47:34,220
how do we tell the AI is what to do and
the what I see what I've tried to do

2384
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:34,230
the what I see what I've tried to do
 

2385
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:36,769
the what I see what I've tried to do
with Wolfram language is to provide a a

2386
00:47:36,769 --> 00:47:36,779
with Wolfram language is to provide a a
 

2387
00:47:36,779 --> 00:47:39,440
with Wolfram language is to provide a a
way of kind of accessing that

2388
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:39,450
way of kind of accessing that
 

2389
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:42,410
way of kind of accessing that
computation and sort of making use of

2390
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:42,420
computation and sort of making use of
 

2391
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,989
computation and sort of making use of
the knowledge that our civilization has

2392
00:47:44,989 --> 00:47:44,999
the knowledge that our civilization has
 

2393
00:47:44,999 --> 00:47:48,829
the knowledge that our civilization has
accumulated and because that's the you

2394
00:47:48,829 --> 00:47:48,839
accumulated and because that's the you
 

2395
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:50,809
accumulated and because that's the you
know there's the general computation on

2396
00:47:50,809 --> 00:47:50,819
know there's the general computation on
 

2397
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:53,239
know there's the general computation on
on this side and there's the specific

2398
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:53,249
on this side and there's the specific
 

2399
00:47:53,249 --> 00:47:54,799
on this side and there's the specific
things that we humans have thought about

2400
00:47:54,799 --> 00:47:54,809
things that we humans have thought about
 

2401
00:47:54,809 --> 00:47:58,160
things that we humans have thought about
and the question is to make use of the

2402
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:58,170
and the question is to make use of the
 

2403
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:00,739
and the question is to make use of the
things that we've thought about to do do

2404
00:48:00,739 --> 00:48:00,749
things that we've thought about to do do
 

2405
00:48:00,749 --> 00:48:02,239
things that we've thought about to do do
things that we care about doing actually

2406
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:02,249
things that we care about doing actually
 

2407
00:48:02,249 --> 00:48:03,799
things that we care about doing actually
if you're interested in these kinds of

2408
00:48:03,799 --> 00:48:03,809
if you're interested in these kinds of
 

2409
00:48:03,809 --> 00:48:05,870
if you're interested in these kinds of
things I happen to just write a blog

2410
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:05,880
things I happen to just write a blog
 

2411
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,410
things I happen to just write a blog
post where last couple of days ago it's

2412
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:09,420
post where last couple of days ago it's

kind
 

2415
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:11,900
kind
the funny blog posts it's about some but

2416
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:11,910
the funny blog posts it's about some but
 

2417
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,789
the funny blog posts it's about some but
you can see the title there it came

2418
00:48:13,789 --> 00:48:13,799
you can see the title there it came
 

2419
00:48:13,799 --> 00:48:15,740
you can see the title there it came
because a friend of miners has this

crazy project to put little little sort
 

2423
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,970
crazy project to put little little sort
of discs or something that should

2424
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:22,980
of discs or something that should
 

2425
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,490
of discs or something that should
represent kind of the best achievements

represent kind of the best achievements
 

2427
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,529
represent kind of the best achievements
of human civilization so to speak to

2428

of human civilization so to speak to
send out it's it's hitchhiking on

into the solar system in the next little
while and the question is what to put on

2436
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:36,420
while and the question is what to put on

this little disc that kind of represents

2438
00:48:38,059 --> 00:48:38,069
this little disc that kind of represents
 

2439
00:48:38,069 --> 00:48:39,980
this little disc that kind of represents
you know the achievements of

2440
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:39,990
you know the achievements of
 

2441
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:41,990
you know the achievements of
civilization it's kind of it's kind of

2442
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:42,000
civilization it's kind of it's kind of
 

2443
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,549
civilization it's kind of it's kind of
depressing when you go back and you look

2444
00:48:43,549 --> 00:48:43,559
depressing when you go back and you look
 

2445
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:45,559
depressing when you go back and you look
at what some what people have tried to

2446
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:45,569
at what some what people have tried to
 

2447
00:48:45,569 --> 00:48:48,499
at what some what people have tried to
do on this before and realizing how hard

2448
00:48:48,499 --> 00:48:48,509
do on this before and realizing how hard
 

2449
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,390
do on this before and realizing how hard
it is to tell even whether something is

2450
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:50,400
it is to tell even whether something is
 

2451
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,230
it is to tell even whether something is
an artifact or not but this is this was

2452
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:54,240
an artifact or not but this is this was
 

2453
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,120
an artifact or not but this is this was
sort of a yeah that's a good one that's

2454
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:56,130
sort of a yeah that's a good one that's
 

2455
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:57,799
sort of a yeah that's a good one that's
from 11,000 years ago can you the

2456
00:48:57,799 --> 00:48:57,809
from 11,000 years ago can you the
 

2457
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:58,999
from 11,000 years ago can you the
question is can you figure out what on

2458
00:48:58,999 --> 00:48:59,009
question is can you figure out what on
 

2459
00:48:59,009 --> 00:49:02,240
question is can you figure out what on
earth it is and what it means and and

2460
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:02,250
earth it is and what it means and and
 

2461
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:06,259
earth it is and what it means and and
this is but but so what what's relevant

2462
00:49:06,259 --> 00:49:06,269
this is but but so what what's relevant
 

2463
00:49:06,269 --> 00:49:09,349
this is but but so what what's relevant
about this is the this this whole

2464
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:09,359
about this is the this this whole
 

2465
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,450
about this is the this this whole
question of there are things that are

2466
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:11,460
question of there are things that are
 

2467
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,069
question of there are things that are
out there in the computational universe

2468
00:49:13,069 --> 00:49:13,079
out there in the computational universe
 

2469
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:15,400
out there in the computational universe
and you know when we think about

2470
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:15,410
and you know when we think about
 

2471
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,900
and you know when we think about
extraterrestrial intelligence I find it

2472
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:17,910
extraterrestrial intelligence I find it
 

2473
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:20,299
extraterrestrial intelligence I find it
kind of interesting that artificial

2474
00:49:20,299 --> 00:49:20,309
kind of interesting that artificial
 

2475
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:22,940
kind of interesting that artificial
intelligence is our first example of an

2476
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:22,950
intelligence is our first example of an
 

2477
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:25,160
intelligence is our first example of an
alien intelligence we don't happen to

2478
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:25,170
alien intelligence we don't happen to
 

2479
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,690
alien intelligence we don't happen to
have found what we view as

2480
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:26,700
have found what we view as
 

2481
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,519
have found what we view as
extraterrestrial intelligence right now

2482
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:28,529
extraterrestrial intelligence right now
 

2483
00:49:28,529 --> 00:49:29,960
extraterrestrial intelligence right now
but we are in the process of building

2484
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:29,970
but we are in the process of building
 

2485
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:32,420
but we are in the process of building
pretty decent version of an alien

2486
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:32,430
pretty decent version of an alien
 

2487
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:34,640
pretty decent version of an alien
intelligence here and the question is if

2488
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:34,650
intelligence here and the question is if
 

2489
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:37,670
intelligence here and the question is if
you ask questions like well you know

2490
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:37,680
you ask questions like well you know
 

2491
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,650
you ask questions like well you know
what is it thinking is it does it have a

2492
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:39,660
what is it thinking is it does it have a
 

2493
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,240
what is it thinking is it does it have a
purpose and what it's doing and so on

2494
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:41,250
purpose and what it's doing and so on
 

2495
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:42,890
purpose and what it's doing and so on
and you're confronted with things like

2496
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:42,900
and you're confronted with things like
 

2497
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,170
and you're confronted with things like
this it's very we you can kind of do a

2498
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:45,180
this it's very we you can kind of do a
 

2499
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:48,499
this it's very we you can kind of do a
test run of you know what's what's its

2500
00:49:48,499 --> 00:49:48,509
test run of you know what's what's its
 

2501
00:49:48,509 --> 00:49:51,589
test run of you know what's what's its
purpose what is it trying to do in a way

2502
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:51,599
purpose what is it trying to do in a way
 

2503
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,150
purpose what is it trying to do in a way
that is very similar to the kinds of

2504
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:53,160
that is very similar to the kinds of
 

2505
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,710
that is very similar to the kinds of
questions you would ask about about

2506
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:54,720
questions you would ask about about
 

2507
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,809
questions you would ask about about
extraterrestrial intelligence but in

2508
00:49:56,809 --> 00:49:56,819
extraterrestrial intelligence but in
 

2509
00:49:56,819 --> 00:50:01,190
extraterrestrial intelligence but in
case the the that the main point is that

2510
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:01,200
case the the that the main point is that
 

2511
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,970
case the the that the main point is that
I see this sort of ocean of computation

2512
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:04,980
I see this sort of ocean of computation
 

2513
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:06,920
I see this sort of ocean of computation
there's the let's describe what we

2514
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:06,930
there's the let's describe what we
 

2515
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:08,450
there's the let's describe what we
actually want to do with that ocean of

2516
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:08,460
actually want to do with that ocean of
 

2517
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,700
actually want to do with that ocean of
computation and that's where you know

2518
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:10,710
computation and that's where you know
 

2519
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:11,809
computation and that's where you know
that's one of the primary problems we

2520
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:11,819
that's one of the primary problems we
 

2521
00:50:11,819 --> 00:50:13,370
that's one of the primary problems we
have now people talk about you know AI

2522
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:13,380
have now people talk about you know AI
 

2523
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,620
have now people talk about you know AI
and what is AI going to allow us to

2524
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:15,630
and what is AI going to allow us to
 

2525
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:18,589
and what is AI going to allow us to
automate and my basic answer that would

2526
00:50:18,589 --> 00:50:18,599
automate and my basic answer that would
 

2527
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:20,990
automate and my basic answer that would
be we'll be able to automate everything

2528
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:21,000
be we'll be able to automate everything
 

2529
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,720
be we'll be able to automate everything
that we can describe the problem is

2530
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:23,730
that we can describe the problem is
 

2531
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,640
that we can describe the problem is
it's not clear what we can describe or

2532
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:25,650
it's not clear what we can describe or
 

2533
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:27,650
it's not clear what we can describe or
put another way you know you imagine

2534
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:27,660
put another way you know you imagine
 

2535
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,300
put another way you know you imagine
various jobs and people are doing things

2536
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:29,310
various jobs and people are doing things
 

2537
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:31,070
various jobs and people are doing things
they're repeated judgment jobs things

2538
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:31,080
they're repeated judgment jobs things
 

2539
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,200
they're repeated judgment jobs things
like this there where we can readily

2540
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:33,210
like this there where we can readily
 

2541
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:35,270
like this there where we can readily
automate those things but the thing that

2542
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:35,280
automate those things but the thing that
 

2543
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,609
automate those things but the thing that
we can't really automate is saying well

2544
00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:37,619
we can't really automate is saying well
 

2545
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:39,770
we can't really automate is saying well
what are we trying to do that is what

2546
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:39,780
what are we trying to do that is what
 

2547
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:42,290
what are we trying to do that is what
are our goals because in a sense when

2548
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:42,300
are our goals because in a sense when
 

2549
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,910
are our goals because in a sense when
when we see one of these systems you

2550
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:43,920
when we see one of these systems you
 

2551
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,490
when we see one of these systems you
know let's say let's say it's a cellular

2552
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:46,500
know let's say let's say it's a cellular
 

2553
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,920
know let's say let's say it's a cellular
tartan here okay the question is what is

2554
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:48,930
tartan here okay the question is what is
 

2555
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:50,630
tartan here okay the question is what is
this cellular automaton trying to do

2556
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:50,640
this cellular automaton trying to do
 

2557
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,670
this cellular automaton trying to do
maybe I can maybe I'll give you another

2558
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:52,680
maybe I can maybe I'll give you another
 

2559
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,200
maybe I can maybe I'll give you another
cellular automaton that is a little bit

2560
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:54,210
cellular automaton that is a little bit
 

2561
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:56,960
cellular automaton that is a little bit
more exciting here let's do this one so

2562
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:56,970
more exciting here let's do this one so
 

2563
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:00,349
more exciting here let's do this one so
that the the question is what is this

2564
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:00,359
that the the question is what is this
 

2565
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:02,660
that the the question is what is this
cellular automaton trying to do you know

2566
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:02,670
cellular automaton trying to do you know
 

2567
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:04,580
cellular automaton trying to do you know
it's got this whole big structure here

2568
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:04,590
it's got this whole big structure here
 

2569
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:06,080
it's got this whole big structure here
and things are happening with it we can

2570
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:06,090
and things are happening with it we can
 

2571
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:07,910
and things are happening with it we can
go we can run it for a couple thousand

2572
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:07,920
go we can run it for a couple thousand
 

2573
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,070
go we can run it for a couple thousand
steps we can ask it's a nice example of

2574
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:10,080
steps we can ask it's a nice example of
 

2575
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,470
steps we can ask it's a nice example of
kind of undecidability in action what's

2576
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:12,480
kind of undecidability in action what's
 

2577
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,580
kind of undecidability in action what's
going to happen here this is kind of the

2578
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:13,590
going to happen here this is kind of the
 

2579
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:15,320
going to happen here this is kind of the
halting problem is this going to halt

2580
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:15,330
halting problem is this going to halt
 

2581
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:17,030
halting problem is this going to halt
what's it going to do

2582
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:17,040
what's it going to do
 

2583
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,980
what's it going to do
there's computational irreducibility so

2584
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:18,990
there's computational irreducibility so
 

2585
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:20,690
there's computational irreducibility so
we actually can't tell this is the case

2586
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:20,700
we actually can't tell this is the case
 

2587
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,040
we actually can't tell this is the case
where we know this is a universal

2588
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:22,050
where we know this is a universal
 

2589
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:25,400
where we know this is a universal
computer in fact eventually well I don't

2590
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:25,410
computer in fact eventually well I don't
 

2591
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:27,109
computer in fact eventually well I don't
even spoil it for you if I went on long

2592
00:51:27,109 --> 00:51:27,119
even spoil it for you if I went on long
 

2593
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,690
even spoil it for you if I went on long
enough it would it would go into some

2594
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:29,700
enough it would it would go into some
 

2595
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:33,440
enough it would it would go into some
kind of cycle but um we can ask what is

2596
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:33,450
kind of cycle but um we can ask what is
 

2597
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:35,359
kind of cycle but um we can ask what is
this thing trying to do what is it you

2598
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:35,369
this thing trying to do what is it you
 

2599
00:51:35,369 --> 00:51:37,280
this thing trying to do what is it you
know is it what's it thinking about

2600
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:37,290
know is it what's it thinking about
 

2601
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:38,330
know is it what's it thinking about
what's its um

2602
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:38,340
what's its um
 

2603
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,770
what's its um
you know what's its goal what's its

2604
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:39,780
you know what's its goal what's its
 

2605
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,710
you know what's its goal what's its
purpose and you know we get very quickly

2606
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:42,720
purpose and you know we get very quickly
 

2607
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,720
purpose and you know we get very quickly
in a big mess thinking about those kinds

2608
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:44,730
in a big mess thinking about those kinds
 

2609
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:46,880
in a big mess thinking about those kinds
of things I've one of the things that

2610
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:46,890
of things I've one of the things that
 

2611
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:47,960
of things I've one of the things that
comes out of this principle of

2612
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:47,970
comes out of this principle of
 

2613
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:50,480
comes out of this principle of
computational equivalence is thinking

2614
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:50,490
computational equivalence is thinking
 

2615
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:55,010
computational equivalence is thinking
about what kinds of things have are

2616
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:55,020
about what kinds of things have are
 

2617
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:57,859
about what kinds of things have are
capable of sophisticated computation so

2618
00:51:57,859 --> 00:51:57,869
capable of sophisticated computation so
 

2619
00:51:57,869 --> 00:52:01,910
capable of sophisticated computation so
so I mentioned a while back here sort of

2620
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:01,920
so I mentioned a while back here sort of
 

2621
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,620
so I mentioned a while back here sort of
my personal history with Wolff malphur

2622
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:03,630
my personal history with Wolff malphur
 

2623
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:05,030
my personal history with Wolff malphur
of having thought about doing something

2624
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:05,040
of having thought about doing something
 

2625
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,620
of having thought about doing something
like wolf now for when I was a kid and

2626
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:06,630
like wolf now for when I was a kid and
 

2627
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:08,270
like wolf now for when I was a kid and
then believing that you sort of had to

2628
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:08,280
then believing that you sort of had to
 

2629
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,950
then believing that you sort of had to
build a brain to make that possible and

2630
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:09,960
build a brain to make that possible and
 

2631
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,950
build a brain to make that possible and
so on and one of the things that I then

2632
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:12,960
so on and one of the things that I then
 

2633
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,900
so on and one of the things that I then
thought was that there was some kind of

2634
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:14,910
thought was that there was some kind of
 

2635
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:18,470
thought was that there was some kind of
bright line between what is intelligent

2636
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:18,480
bright line between what is intelligent
 

2637
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,960
bright line between what is intelligent
and what is merely computational so to

2638
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:20,970
and what is merely computational so to
 

2639
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:22,849
and what is merely computational so to
speak in other words that there was

2640
00:52:22,849 --> 00:52:22,859
speak in other words that there was
 

2641
00:52:22,859 --> 00:52:24,410
speak in other words that there was
something which is like oh we've got

2642
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:24,420
something which is like oh we've got
 

2643
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,940
something which is like oh we've got
this great thing that we humans have

2644
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:25,950
this great thing that we humans have
 

2645
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:28,250
this great thing that we humans have
that you know as intelligence and all

2646
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:28,260
that you know as intelligence and all
 

2647
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:30,230
that you know as intelligence and all
these things in nature and so on and all

2648
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:30,240
these things in nature and so on and all
 

2649
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,000
these things in nature and so on and all
the stuff that's going on it's just

2650
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:32,010
the stuff that's going on it's just
 

2651
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:34,490
the stuff that's going on it's just
computation or it's just you know things

2652
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:34,500
computation or it's just you know things
 

2653
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,750
computation or it's just you know things
operating according to rules that's

2654
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:35,760
operating according to rules that's
 

2655
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,220
operating according to rules that's
different there's some bright line

2656
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:37,230
different there's some bright line
 

2657
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:37,940
different there's some bright line
distinction

2658
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:37,950
distinction
 

2659
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:40,099
distinction
doing these things well I think the

2660
00:52:40,099 --> 00:52:40,109
doing these things well I think the
 

2661
00:52:40,109 --> 00:52:42,349
doing these things well I think the
thing that came about after I'd looked

2662
00:52:42,349 --> 00:52:42,359
thing that came about after I'd looked
 

2663
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:44,480
thing that came about after I'd looked
at all these cellular automata and all

2664
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:44,490
at all these cellular automata and all
 

2665
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:45,770
at all these cellular automata and all
kinds of other things like that

2666
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:45,780
kinds of other things like that
 

2667
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:48,770
kinds of other things like that
is I sort of came up with this principle

2668
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:48,780
is I sort of came up with this principle
 

2669
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:51,829
is I sort of came up with this principle
of computational equivalence idea which

2670
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:51,839
of computational equivalence idea which
 

2671
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,270
of computational equivalence idea which
we've now got quite a lot of evidence

2672
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:53,280
we've now got quite a lot of evidence
 

2673
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,859
we've now got quite a lot of evidence
for which I talked about people are

2674
00:52:54,859 --> 00:52:54,869
for which I talked about people are
 

2675
00:52:54,869 --> 00:52:58,550
for which I talked about people are
interested in but that basically there

2676
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:58,560
interested in but that basically there
 

2677
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,339
interested in but that basically there
isn't a that once you reach a certain

2678
00:53:01,339 --> 00:53:01,349
isn't a that once you reach a certain
 

2679
00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:03,800
isn't a that once you reach a certain
level of of computational sophistication

2680
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:03,810
level of of computational sophistication
 

2681
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:05,990
level of of computational sophistication
everything is equivalent and that means

2682
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:06,000
everything is equivalent and that means
 

2683
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,569
everything is equivalent and that means
that that implies that there really

2684
00:53:08,569 --> 00:53:08,579
that that implies that there really
 

2685
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:10,400
that that implies that there really
isn't a bright line distinction between

2686
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:10,410
isn't a bright line distinction between
 

2687
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:12,200
isn't a bright line distinction between
for example the computations going on in

2688
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:12,210
for example the computations going on in
 

2689
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:14,300
for example the computations going on in
our brains and the computations going on

2690
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:14,310
our brains and the computations going on
 

2691
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:15,800
our brains and the computations going on
in these simple cellular automata and so

2692
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:15,810
in these simple cellular automata and so
 

2693
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:17,780
in these simple cellular automata and so
on and that essentially philosophical

2694
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:17,790
on and that essentially philosophical
 

2695
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:19,819
on and that essentially philosophical
point is what actually got me to start

2696
00:53:19,819 --> 00:53:19,829
point is what actually got me to start
 

2697
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:21,770
point is what actually got me to start
trying to build both malphur because I

2698
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:21,780
trying to build both malphur because I
 

2699
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:23,569
trying to build both malphur because I
realized that gosh you know I've been

2700
00:53:23,569 --> 00:53:23,579
realized that gosh you know I've been
 

2701
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:25,640
realized that gosh you know I've been
looking for this sort of the the magic

2702
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:25,650
looking for this sort of the the magic
 

2703
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:27,349
looking for this sort of the the magic
bullet of intelligence and I just

2704
00:53:27,349 --> 00:53:27,359
bullet of intelligence and I just
 

2705
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:28,910
bullet of intelligence and I just
decided probably there isn't one and

2706
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:28,920
decided probably there isn't one and
 

2707
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,490
decided probably there isn't one and
actually it's all just computation and

2708
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:31,500
actually it's all just computation and
 

2709
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,569
actually it's all just computation and
so that means we can actually

2710
00:53:32,569 --> 00:53:32,579
so that means we can actually
 

2711
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:35,060
so that means we can actually
impractical

2712
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:35,070
impractical
 

2713
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:37,880
impractical
intelligent like thing and so that's

2714
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:37,890
intelligent like thing and so that's
 

2715
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:39,950
intelligent like thing and so that's
what I think is the case is that there

2716
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:39,960
what I think is the case is that there
 

2717
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,329
what I think is the case is that there
really isn't sort of a bright line

2718
00:53:41,329 --> 00:53:41,339
really isn't sort of a bright line
 

2719
00:53:41,339 --> 00:53:43,220
really isn't sort of a bright line
distinction and that has that has more

2720
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:43,230
distinction and that has that has more
 

2721
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:44,870
distinction and that has that has more
extreme consequences like people will

2722
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:44,880
extreme consequences like people will
 

2723
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,700
extreme consequences like people will
say things like you know the weather has

2724
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:46,710
say things like you know the weather has
 

2725
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:48,559
say things like you know the weather has
a mind of its own okay

2726
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:48,569
a mind of its own okay
 

2727
00:53:48,569 --> 00:53:50,300
a mind of its own okay
sounds kind of silly sounds kind of

2728
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:50,310
sounds kind of silly sounds kind of
 

2729
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,520
sounds kind of silly sounds kind of
animistic primitive and so on but in

2730
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:52,530
animistic primitive and so on but in
 

2731
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:55,760
animistic primitive and so on but in
fact the you know fluid dynamics of the

2732
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:55,770
fact the you know fluid dynamics of the
 

2733
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:57,800
fact the you know fluid dynamics of the
weather is as computationally

2734
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:57,810
weather is as computationally
 

2735
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:00,170
weather is as computationally
sophisticated as the stuff that goes on

2736
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:00,180
sophisticated as the stuff that goes on
 

2737
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:03,380
sophisticated as the stuff that goes on
in our brains but we can start asking

2738
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:03,390
in our brains but we can start asking
 

2739
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:04,640
in our brains but we can start asking
but then you say but the weather doesn't

2740
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:04,650
but then you say but the weather doesn't
 

2741
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:06,500
but then you say but the weather doesn't
have a purpose you know what's the

2742
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:06,510
have a purpose you know what's the
 

2743
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:08,059
have a purpose you know what's the
purpose of the weather well you know

2744
00:54:08,059 --> 00:54:08,069
purpose of the weather well you know
 

2745
00:54:08,069 --> 00:54:10,069
purpose of the weather well you know
maybe the weather is trying to equalize

2746
00:54:10,069 --> 00:54:10,079
maybe the weather is trying to equalize
 

2747
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:12,109
maybe the weather is trying to equalize
the temperature between the you know the

2748
00:54:12,109 --> 00:54:12,119
the temperature between the you know the
 

2749
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:14,210
the temperature between the you know the
the North Pole and the tropics or

2750
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:14,220
the North Pole and the tropics or
 

2751
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,550
the North Pole and the tropics or
something and then we have to say well

2752
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:16,560
something and then we have to say well
 

2753
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,319
something and then we have to say well
but that's not a purpose in the way that

2754
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:18,329
but that's not a purpose in the way that
 

2755
00:54:18,329 --> 00:54:20,660
but that's not a purpose in the way that
we think about purposes that's just you

2756
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:20,670
we think about purposes that's just you
 

2757
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:22,550
we think about purposes that's just you
know and we get very confused and in the

2758
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:22,560
know and we get very confused and in the
 

2759
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,290
know and we get very confused and in the
end what we realize is when we're

2760
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:24,300
end what we realize is when we're
 

2761
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,690
end what we realize is when we're
talking about things like purposes we

2762
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:26,700
talking about things like purposes we
 

2763
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,599
talking about things like purposes we
have to have this kind of chain of

2764
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:28,609
have to have this kind of chain of
 

2765
00:54:28,609 --> 00:54:31,640
have to have this kind of chain of
provenance that goes back to humans and

2766
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:31,650
provenance that goes back to humans and
 

2767
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:33,170
provenance that goes back to humans and
human history and all that kind of thing

2768
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:33,180
human history and all that kind of thing
 

2769
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:35,300
human history and all that kind of thing
and I think it's the same type of thing

2770
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:35,310
and I think it's the same type of thing
 

2771
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:36,829
and I think it's the same type of thing
when we talk about computation and AI

2772
00:54:36,829 --> 00:54:36,839
when we talk about computation and AI
 

2773
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:39,950
when we talk about computation and AI
and so on the thing that we this

2774
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:39,960
and so on the thing that we this
 

2775
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,470
and so on the thing that we this
question of sort of purpose goals things

2776
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:42,480
question of sort of purpose goals things
 

2777
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,359
question of sort of purpose goals things
like this that's a thing which is

2778
00:54:44,359 --> 00:54:44,369
like this that's a thing which is
 

2779
00:54:44,369 --> 00:54:47,180
like this that's a thing which is
intrinsically human and not something

2780
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:47,190
intrinsically human and not something
 

2781
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:48,800
intrinsically human and not something
that we can ever sort of automatically

2782
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:48,810
that we can ever sort of automatically
 

2783
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:50,390
that we can ever sort of automatically
generate it makes no sense to talk about

2784
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:50,400
generate it makes no sense to talk about
 

2785
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,650
generate it makes no sense to talk about
automatically generating it

2786
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:51,660
automatically generating it
 

2787
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,540
automatically generating it
because these computational systems they

2788
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:53,550
because these computational systems they
 

2789
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:55,520
because these computational systems they
do all kinds of stuff you know we can

2790
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:55,530
do all kinds of stuff you know we can
 

2791
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:56,720
do all kinds of stuff you know we can
say they've got a purpose we can

2792
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:56,730
say they've got a purpose we can
 

2793
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:58,190
say they've got a purpose we can
attribute purposes to them etcetera

2794
00:54:58,190 --> 00:54:58,200
attribute purposes to them etcetera
 

2795
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:58,880
attribute purposes to them etcetera
etcetera etcetera

2796
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:58,890
etcetera etcetera
 

2797
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:01,010
etcetera etcetera
but you know ultimately it's sort of the

2798
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:01,020
but you know ultimately it's sort of the
 

2799
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,960
but you know ultimately it's sort of the
human thread of purpose that we have to

2800
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:02,970
human thread of purpose that we have to
 

2801
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:05,060
human thread of purpose that we have to
have to deal with so that means for

2802
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:05,070
have to deal with so that means for
 

2803
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:07,010
have to deal with so that means for
example when we talk about AIS and we

2804
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:07,020
example when we talk about AIS and we
 

2805
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:08,780
example when we talk about AIS and we
were interested in things like so how do

2806
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:08,790
were interested in things like so how do
 

2807
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:11,000
were interested in things like so how do
we tell you know like like we'd like to

2808
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:11,010
we tell you know like like we'd like to
 

2809
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:13,310
we tell you know like like we'd like to
be able to tell we talk about AI ethics

2810
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:13,320
be able to tell we talk about AI ethics
 

2811
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,590
be able to tell we talk about AI ethics
for example we'd like to be able to make

2812
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:15,600
for example we'd like to be able to make
 

2813
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,050
for example we'd like to be able to make
a statement to the AIS like you know

2814
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:18,060
a statement to the AIS like you know
 

2815
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:21,320
a statement to the AIS like you know
please be nice to us humans um and

2816
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:21,330
please be nice to us humans um and
 

2817
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:24,710
please be nice to us humans um and
that's a you know that's something so

2818
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:24,720
that's a you know that's something so
 

2819
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,260
that's a you know that's something so
one of the issues there is so talking

2820
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:27,270
one of the issues there is so talking
 

2821
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:30,500
one of the issues there is so talking
about that kind of thing one of the

2822
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:30,510
about that kind of thing one of the
 

2823
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:32,120
about that kind of thing one of the
issues is how are we going to make a

2824
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:32,130
issues is how are we going to make a
 

2825
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:34,250
issues is how are we going to make a
statement like be nice to us humans

2826
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:34,260
statement like be nice to us humans
 

2827
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,800
statement like be nice to us humans
what's the you know in how are we going

2828
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:36,810
what's the you know in how are we going
 

2829
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:39,560
what's the you know in how are we going
to explain that to an AI and this is

2830
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:39,570
to explain that to an AI and this is
 

2831
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:42,980
to explain that to an AI and this is
where again you know my my efforts to

2832
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:42,990
where again you know my my efforts to
 

2833
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:45,020
where again you know my my efforts to
build a language a computational

2834
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:45,030
build a language a computational
 

2835
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:47,410
build a language a computational
communication language that bridges the

2836
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:47,420
communication language that bridges the
 

2837
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:50,240
communication language that bridges the
world of what we humans think about and

2838
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:50,250
world of what we humans think about and
 

2839
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,950
world of what we humans think about and
the world of what is possible in

2840
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:51,960
the world of what is possible in
 

2841
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,290
the world of what is possible in
computation is important and so one of

2842
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:54,300
computation is important and so one of
 

2843
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,430
computation is important and so one of
things I've been interested in is

2844
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:55,440
things I've been interested in is
 

2845
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,410
things I've been interested in is
actually building what I call a symbolic

2846
00:55:57,410 --> 00:55:57,420
actually building what I call a symbolic
 

2847
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,900
actually building what I call a symbolic
discourse language that can be a general

2848
00:55:59,900 --> 00:55:59,910
discourse language that can be a general
 

2849
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:03,350
discourse language that can be a general
representation for sort of the kinds of

2850
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:03,360
representation for sort of the kinds of
 

2851
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:07,820
representation for sort of the kinds of
things that we might want to put in that

2852
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:07,830
things that we might want to put in that
 

2853
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:10,640
things that we might want to put in that
we might want to to say and things like

2854
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:10,650
we might want to to say and things like
 

2855
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:12,500
we might want to to say and things like
be nice to him and so sort of a little

2856
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:12,510
be nice to him and so sort of a little
 

2857
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:14,330
be nice to him and so sort of a little
bit background to that so you know in

2858
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:14,340
bit background to that so you know in
 

2859
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:16,010
bit background to that so you know in
the modern world people are keen on

2860
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:16,020
the modern world people are keen on
 

2861
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:18,590
the modern world people are keen on
smart contracts they often think of them

2862
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:18,600
smart contracts they often think of them
 

2863
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,150
smart contracts they often think of them
as being deeply tied into blockchain

2864
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:20,160
as being deeply tied into blockchain
 

2865
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,050
as being deeply tied into blockchain
which I don't think is really quite

2866
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:21,060
which I don't think is really quite
 

2867
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:21,620
which I don't think is really quite
right

2868
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:21,630
right
 

2869
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:23,570
right
the important thing about smart

2870
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:23,580
the important thing about smart
 

2871
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:26,330
the important thing about smart
contracts is it's a way of having sort

2872
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:26,340
contracts is it's a way of having sort
 

2873
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:29,180
contracts is it's a way of having sort
of an agreement between parties which

2874
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:29,190
of an agreement between parties which
 

2875
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:31,430
of an agreement between parties which
can be executed automatically and that

2876
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:31,440
can be executed automatically and that
 

2877
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,680
can be executed automatically and that
agreement may be you know you may choose

2878
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:33,690
agreement may be you know you may choose
 

2879
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:36,740
agreement may be you know you may choose
to sort of anchor that agreement in a

2880
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:36,750
to sort of anchor that agreement in a
 

2881
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:38,600
to sort of anchor that agreement in a
blockchain you may not but the whole

2882
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:38,610
blockchain you may not but the whole
 

2883
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:40,340
blockchain you may not but the whole
point is you have to what you you know

2884
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:40,350
point is you have to what you you know
 

2885
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:42,680
point is you have to what you you know
when people write legal contracts they

2886
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:42,690
when people write legal contracts they
 

2887
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,120
when people write legal contracts they
write them in an approximation to

2888
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:44,130
write them in an approximation to
 

2889
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:45,650
write them in an approximation to
English they write them in legalese

2890
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:45,660
English they write them in legalese
 

2891
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:47,030
English they write them in legalese
typically because they're trying to

2892
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:47,040
typically because they're trying to
 

2893
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:47,960
typically because they're trying to
write them in something a little bit

2894
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:47,970
write them in something a little bit
 

2895
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:50,210
write them in something a little bit
more precise than regular English but

2896
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:50,220
more precise than regular English but
 

2897
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,940
more precise than regular English but
the limiting case of that is to make a

2898
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:52,950
the limiting case of that is to make a
 

2899
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:55,340
the limiting case of that is to make a
symbolic discourse language in which you

2900
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:55,350
symbolic discourse language in which you
 

2901
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:57,200
symbolic discourse language in which you
can write the contract and code

2902
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:57,210
can write the contract and code
 

2903
00:56:57,210 --> 00:57:00,560
can write the contract and code
basically and the the I've been very

2904
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:00,570
basically and the the I've been very
 

2905
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:02,090
basically and the the I've been very
interested in using wolfmann language to

2906
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:02,100
interested in using wolfmann language to
 

2907
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:03,950
interested in using wolfmann language to
do that because in wolfen language we

2908
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:03,960
do that because in wolfen language we
 

2909
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,450
do that because in wolfen language we
have a language which Candice

2910
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:05,460
have a language which Candice
 

2911
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,970
have a language which Candice
bribe things about the world and we can

2912
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:07,980
bribe things about the world and we can
 

2913
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:10,250
bribe things about the world and we can
talk about the kinds of things that

2914
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:10,260
talk about the kinds of things that
 

2915
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,020
talk about the kinds of things that
people actually talk about in contracts

2916
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:12,030
people actually talk about in contracts
 

2917
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:14,450
people actually talk about in contracts
and so on and we're most of the way

2918
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:14,460
and so on and we're most of the way
 

2919
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:18,140
and so on and we're most of the way
there to being able to do that and then

2920
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:18,150
there to being able to do that and then
 

2921
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:19,700
there to being able to do that and then
when you start thinking about that you

2922
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:19,710
when you start thinking about that you
 

2923
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:21,620
when you start thinking about that you
start thinking about okay so we've got

2924
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:21,630
start thinking about okay so we've got
 

2925
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:24,500
start thinking about okay so we've got
this language to describe things that we

2926
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:24,510
this language to describe things that we
 

2927
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:26,990
this language to describe things that we
that we care about in the world and so

2928
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:27,000
that we care about in the world and so
 

2929
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,910
that we care about in the world and so
when it comes to things like tell the

2930
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:28,920
when it comes to things like tell the
 

2931
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,430
when it comes to things like tell the
AIS to be nice to the humans we can

2932
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:31,440
AIS to be nice to the humans we can
 

2933
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,099
AIS to be nice to the humans we can
imagine using often language to sort of

2934
00:57:34,099 --> 00:57:34,109
imagine using often language to sort of
 

2935
00:57:34,109 --> 00:57:36,349
imagine using often language to sort of
build an AI Constitution that says this

2936
00:57:36,349 --> 00:57:36,359
build an AI Constitution that says this
 

2937
00:57:36,359 --> 00:57:38,930
build an AI Constitution that says this
is how the AI supposed to work but when

2938
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:38,940
is how the AI supposed to work but when
 

2939
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:41,030
is how the AI supposed to work but when
we talk about sort of just the the

2940
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:41,040
we talk about sort of just the the
 

2941
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,099
we talk about sort of just the the
untethered you know the untethered AI

2942
00:57:43,099 --> 00:57:43,109
untethered you know the untethered AI
 

2943
00:57:43,109 --> 00:57:45,560
untethered you know the untethered AI
doesn't have any particular it's just

2944
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:45,570
doesn't have any particular it's just
 

2945
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:47,780
doesn't have any particular it's just
going to do what it does and if we want

2946
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:47,790
going to do what it does and if we want
 

2947
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:49,460
going to do what it does and if we want
it to you know if we want to somehow

2948
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:49,470
it to you know if we want to somehow
 

2949
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:51,980
it to you know if we want to somehow
align it with human purposes we have to

2950
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:51,990
align it with human purposes we have to
 

2951
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:53,839
align it with human purposes we have to
have some way to sort of talk to the AI

2952
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:53,849
have some way to sort of talk to the AI
 

2953
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:58,099
have some way to sort of talk to the AI
and that's that's a you know I view my

2954
00:57:58,099 --> 00:57:58,109
and that's that's a you know I view my
 

2955
00:57:58,109 --> 00:58:00,470
and that's that's a you know I view my
efforts to build or from language as as

2956
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:00,480
efforts to build or from language as as
 

2957
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,480
efforts to build or from language as as
a way to do that I mean I you know as I

2958
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:02,490
a way to do that I mean I you know as I
 

2959
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:05,329
a way to do that I mean I you know as I
was showing at the beginning you can use

2960
00:58:05,329 --> 00:58:05,339
was showing at the beginning you can use
 

2961
00:58:05,339 --> 00:58:08,690
was showing at the beginning you can use
you can take natural language and with

2962
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:08,700
you can take natural language and with
 

2963
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,070
you can take natural language and with
natural language you can build up a

2964
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:10,080
natural language you can build up a
 

2965
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,440
natural language you can build up a
certain amount of you can say a certain

2966
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:12,450
certain amount of you can say a certain
 

2967
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:14,150
certain amount of you can say a certain
number of things in natural language you

2968
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:14,160
number of things in natural language you
 

2969
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,560
number of things in natural language you
can then say well how do we make this

2970
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:15,570
can then say well how do we make this
 

2971
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:17,660
can then say well how do we make this
more precise in a precise symbolic

2972
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:17,670
more precise in a precise symbolic
 

2973
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:19,520
more precise in a precise symbolic
language if you want to build up more

2974
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:19,530
language if you want to build up more
 

2975
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:21,829
language if you want to build up more
complicated things it gets hard to do

2976
00:58:21,829 --> 00:58:21,839
complicated things it gets hard to do
 

2977
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:23,690
complicated things it gets hard to do
that in natural language and so you have

2978
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:23,700
that in natural language and so you have
 

2979
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,460
that in natural language and so you have
to kind of build up more serious

2980
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:25,470
to kind of build up more serious
 

2981
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:28,970
to kind of build up more serious
programs in in in symbolic language and

2982
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:28,980
programs in in in symbolic language and
 

2983
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:32,300
programs in in in symbolic language and
I've probably been numb been yakking a

2984
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:32,310
I've probably been numb been yakking a
 

2985
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:32,930
I've probably been numb been yakking a
while here

2986
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:32,940
while here
 

2987
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:35,870
while here
and I'm happy to I can talk about all

2988
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:35,880
and I'm happy to I can talk about all
 

2989
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,400
and I'm happy to I can talk about all
kinds of different things here but that

2990
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:37,410
kinds of different things here but that
 

2991
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:40,310
kinds of different things here but that
maybe I've not seen as many reactions as

2992
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:40,320
maybe I've not seen as many reactions as
 

2993
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,349
maybe I've not seen as many reactions as
I might have expected to think so I I'm

2994
00:58:42,349 --> 00:58:42,359
I might have expected to think so I I'm
 

2995
00:58:42,359 --> 00:58:43,609
I might have expected to think so I I'm
not sure which things people are

2996
00:58:43,609 --> 00:58:43,619
not sure which things people are
 

2997
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:45,079
not sure which things people are
interested in which they're not but so

2998
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:45,089
interested in which they're not but so
 

2999
00:58:45,089 --> 00:58:47,870
interested in which they're not but so
maybe I should maybe I should stop here

maybe I should maybe I should stop here
 

3001
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,849
maybe I should maybe I should stop here

Wolfram Alpha language you know how
 

3039
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:31,660

would you go about doing that me okay so

3040
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:31,670
would you go about doing that me okay so
 

3041
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:34,040
would you go about doing that me okay so
we've done maybe a couple of thousand

we've done maybe a couple of thousand
 

3043
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:37,490
we've done maybe a couple of thousand
domains okay the what is actually

3044
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:37,500
domains okay the what is actually
 

3045
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,200
domains okay the what is actually
involved in doing one of these domains

3046
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:39,210
involved in doing one of these domains
 

3047
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:42,950
involved in doing one of these domains
it's it's a gnarly business every domain

3048
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:42,960
it's it's a gnarly business every domain
 

3049
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,109
it's it's a gnarly business every domain
has some crazy different thing about it

00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:47,500

I tried to make up actually a while ago

3052
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:47,510
I tried to make up actually a while ago
 

3053
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:50,960
I tried to make up actually a while ago
we um let me show you something a kind

3054
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:50,970
we um let me show you something a kind
 

3055
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:53,450
we um let me show you something a kind
of a hierarchy of what it means to make

3056
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:53,460
of a hierarchy of what it means to make
 

3057
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:56,240
of a hierarchy of what it means to make
um see if I can find this here kind of a

3058
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:56,250
um see if I can find this here kind of a
 

3059
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:58,010
um see if I can find this here kind of a
hierarchy of what it means to make a

3060
00:59:58,010 --> 00:59:58,020
hierarchy of what it means to make a
 

3061
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:08,660
hierarchy of what it means to make a
domain computable where is it that's

3062
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:08,670
domain computable where is it that's
 

3063
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:10,550
domain computable where is it that's
okay here we go so there's sort of a

3064
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:10,560
okay here we go so there's sort of a
 

3065
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,770
okay here we go so there's sort of a
hierarchy of levels of what it means to

3066
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:12,780
hierarchy of levels of what it means to
 

3067
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:16,010
hierarchy of levels of what it means to
make a domain computable from just you

3068
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:16,020
make a domain computable from just you
 

3069
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:17,900
make a domain computable from just you
know you've got some you know you've got

3070
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:17,910
know you've got some you know you've got
 

3071
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:19,220
know you've got some you know you've got
some array of data that's quite

3072
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:19,230
some array of data that's quite
 

3073
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:21,380
some array of data that's quite
structured forget you know the separate

issue about extracting things from
 

3077
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:24,859
issue about extracting things from
unstructured data but let's imagine that

3078
01:00:24,859 --> 01:00:24,869
unstructured data but let's imagine that
 

3079
01:00:24,869 --> 01:00:28,070
unstructured data but let's imagine that
you were given you know a a bunch of

01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:28,080
you were given you know a a bunch of
 

3081
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,829
you were given you know a a bunch of

3082
01:00:30,829 --> 01:00:30,839
data about landing sites of meteorites
 

3083
01:00:30,839 --> 01:00:33,170

or something okay so you go through

3084
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:33,180
or something okay so you go through
 

3085
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:35,410
or something okay so you go through
various levels so you know things like

3086
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:35,420
various levels so you know things like
 

3087
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:37,609
various levels so you know things like
okay the landing sites the meteorites

3088
01:00:37,609 --> 01:00:37,619
okay the landing sites the meteorites
 

3089
01:00:37,619 --> 01:00:39,920
okay the landing sites the meteorites
are the are the positions just strings

3090
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:39,930
are the are the positions just strings
 

3091
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:41,599
are the are the positions just strings
or they some kind of canonical

3092
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:41,609
or they some kind of canonical
 

3093
01:00:41,609 --> 01:00:44,240
or they some kind of canonical
representation of geo position is the

3094
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:44,250
representation of geo position is the
 

3095
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,640
representation of geo position is the
you know is the type of meteorite you

3096
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:46,650
you know is the type of meteorite you
 

3097
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:48,170
you know is the type of meteorite you
know some of them are iron meteorites

3098
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:48,180
know some of them are iron meteorites
 

3099
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:49,790
know some of them are iron meteorites
some of them are stone meteorites have

3100
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:49,800
some of them are stone meteorites have
 

3101
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,339
some of them are stone meteorites have
you made a canonical representation have

3102
01:00:52,339 --> 01:00:52,349
you made a canonical representation have
 

3103
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:56,300
you made a canonical representation have
you made some kind of way to to identify

3104
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:56,310
you made some kind of way to to identify
 

3105
01:00:56,310 --> 01:01:00,020
you made some kind of way to to identify
what some sorry go ahead no no I mean to

3106
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:00,030
what some sorry go ahead no no I mean to
 

3107
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:01,940
what some sorry go ahead no no I mean to
do that so my question is like you know

3108
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:01,950
do that so my question is like you know
 

3109
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:04,040
do that so my question is like you know
if you did have positions as a string as

3110
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:04,050
if you did have positions as a string as
 

3111
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:05,990
if you did have positions as a string as
well as a canonical representation do

3112
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:06,000
well as a canonical representation do
 

3113
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:06,830
well as a canonical representation do
you have redundant

3114
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:06,840
you have redundant
 

3115
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,990
you have redundant
pieces of the same redundant

3116
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:09,000
pieces of the same redundant
 

3117
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,550
pieces of the same redundant
representations of the same information

3118
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:10,560
representations of the same information
 

3119
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:15,140
representations of the same information
in the different no I mean I'll go you

3120
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:15,150
in the different no I mean I'll go you
 

3121
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:16,490
in the different no I mean I'll go you
always everything canonical that you

3122
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:16,500
always everything canonical that you
 

3123
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,750
always everything canonical that you
have yeah I have a minimal

3124
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:17,760
have yeah I have a minimal
 

3125
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,040
have yeah I have a minimal
representation of everything yeah our

3126
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:19,050
representation of everything yeah our
 

3127
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,380
representation of everything yeah our
goal is to make everything canonical now

3128
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:21,390
goal is to make everything canonical now
 

3129
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:23,750
goal is to make everything canonical now
that's you know there is a lot of

3130
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:23,760
that's you know there is a lot of
 

3131
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,640
that's you know there is a lot of
complexity in doing that I mean if you

3132
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:25,650
complexity in doing that I mean if you
 

3133
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:28,490
complexity in doing that I mean if you
you know in each okay so another feature

3134
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:28,500
you know in each okay so another feature
 

3135
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,570
you know in each okay so another feature
of these domains

3136
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:29,580
of these domains
 

3137
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:31,490
of these domains
okay so there's another another thing to

3138
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:31,500
okay so there's another another thing to
 

3139
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:35,180
okay so there's another another thing to
say um you know it will be lovely if one

3140
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:35,190
say um you know it will be lovely if one
 

3141
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:36,620
say um you know it will be lovely if one
could just automate everything and cut

3142
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:36,630
could just automate everything and cut
 

3143
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:37,760
could just automate everything and cut
the humans out of the loop

3144
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:37,770
the humans out of the loop
 

3145
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:41,060
the humans out of the loop
turns out this doesn't work and in fact

3146
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:41,070
turns out this doesn't work and in fact
 

3147
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:43,280
turns out this doesn't work and in fact
whenever we do these domains it's fairly

3148
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:43,290
whenever we do these domains it's fairly
 

3149
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:45,470
whenever we do these domains it's fairly
critical to have expert humans who

3150
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:45,480
critical to have expert humans who
 

3151
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:46,850
critical to have expert humans who
really understand the domain or you

3152
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:46,860
really understand the domain or you
 

3153
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:50,270
really understand the domain or you
simply get it wrong and it's also having

3154
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:50,280
simply get it wrong and it's also having
 

3155
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,770
simply get it wrong and it's also having
said that once you've done enough

3156
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:51,780
said that once you've done enough
 

3157
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:53,120
said that once you've done enough
domains you can do a lot of cross

3158
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:53,130
domains you can do a lot of cross
 

3159
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:55,850
domains you can do a lot of cross
checking between domains and we are the

3160
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:55,860
checking between domains and we are the
 

3161
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:58,700
checking between domains and we are the
number one reporters of error and of

3162
01:01:58,700 --> 01:01:58,710
number one reporters of error and of
 

3163
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:00,230
number one reporters of error and of
errors and in pretty much all

3164
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:00,240
errors and in pretty much all
 

3165
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,750
errors and in pretty much all
standardized data sources because we can

3166
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:02,760
standardized data sources because we can
 

3167
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,760
standardized data sources because we can
do that kind of cross checking but I

3168
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:04,770
do that kind of cross checking but I
 

3169
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:06,340
do that kind of cross checking but I
think you know if you ask the question

3170
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:06,350
think you know if you ask the question
 

3171
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:11,060
think you know if you ask the question
what's involved in in bringing online a

3172
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:11,070
what's involved in in bringing online a
 

3173
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:14,300
what's involved in in bringing online a
new domain it's you know those sort of

3174
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:14,310
new domain it's you know those sort of
 

3175
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:16,340
new domain it's you know those sort of
hierarchy of things you know some of

3176
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:16,350
hierarchy of things you know some of
 

3177
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:18,530
hierarchy of things you know some of
those take a few hours you can get to

3178
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:18,540
those take a few hours you can get to
 

3179
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:20,540
those take a few hours you can get to
the point of of having you know we've

3180
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:20,550
the point of of having you know we've
 

3181
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:22,690
the point of of having you know we've
got good enough tools for ingesting data

3182
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:22,700
got good enough tools for ingesting data
 

3183
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,740
got good enough tools for ingesting data
figuring out oh those are names of

3184
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:24,750
figuring out oh those are names of
 

3185
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:26,630
figuring out oh those are names of
cities in that column let's you know

3186
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:26,640
cities in that column let's you know
 

3187
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,060
cities in that column let's you know
that's canonicalized those you know some

3188
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:29,070
that's canonicalized those you know some
 

3189
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:30,620
that's canonicalized those you know some
may be questions but many of them will

3190
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:30,630
may be questions but many of them will
 

3191
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:33,830
may be questions but many of them will
be able to to nail down and to get to

3192
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:33,840
be able to to nail down and to get to
 

3193
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,510
be able to to nail down and to get to
the full level of you've got some

3194
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:35,520
the full level of you've got some
 

3195
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,310
the full level of you've got some
complicated domain and it's fully

3196
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:37,320
complicated domain and it's fully
 

3197
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,390
complicated domain and it's fully
computable is probably a year of work

3198
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:40,400
computable is probably a year of work
 

3199
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,300
computable is probably a year of work
and and you might say well gosh why are

3200
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:44,310
and and you might say well gosh why are
 

3201
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:45,560
and and you might say well gosh why are
you wasting you their time you've got to

3202
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:45,570
you wasting you their time you've got to
 

3203
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:46,970
you wasting you their time you've got to
be able to automate that so you can

3204
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:46,980
be able to automate that so you can
 

3205
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:48,290
be able to automate that so you can
probably tell we're fairly sophisticated

3206
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:48,300
probably tell we're fairly sophisticated
 

3207
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,090
probably tell we're fairly sophisticated
about machine learning kinds of things

3208
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:50,100
about machine learning kinds of things
 

3209
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,670
about machine learning kinds of things
and so on and we have tried you know to

3210
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:52,680
and so on and we have tried you know to
 

3211
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,100
and so on and we have tried you know to
automate as much as we can and we have

3212
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:55,110
automate as much as we can and we have
 

3213
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:57,350
automate as much as we can and we have
got a pretty efficient pipeline but if

3214
01:02:57,350 --> 01:02:57,360
got a pretty efficient pipeline but if
 

3215
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,820
got a pretty efficient pipeline but if
you actually want to get it right and

3216
01:02:58,820 --> 01:02:58,830
you actually want to get it right and
 

3217
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:01,250
you actually want to get it right and
you see it is an example of what what

3218
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:01,260
you see it is an example of what what
 

3219
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:03,680
you see it is an example of what what
happens that there's a level even going

3220
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:03,690
happens that there's a level even going
 

3221
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:05,330
happens that there's a level even going
between wolf now for more from language

3222
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:05,340
between wolf now for more from language
 

3223
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:08,090
between wolf now for more from language
there's a level of so for example let's

3224
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:08,100
there's a level of so for example let's
 

3225
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:10,820
there's a level of so for example let's
say you're looking at you know lakes in

3226
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:10,830
say you're looking at you know lakes in
 

3227
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:13,460
say you're looking at you know lakes in
Wisconsin okay so people are querying

3228
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:13,470
Wisconsin okay so people are querying
 

3229
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:14,750
Wisconsin okay so people are querying
about lakes in Wisconsin and

3230
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:14,760
about lakes in Wisconsin and
 

3231
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,700
about lakes in Wisconsin and
WolframAlpha they'll name a particular

3232
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:16,710
WolframAlpha they'll name a particular
 

3233
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:18,650
WolframAlpha they'll name a particular
lake and they want to know you know how

3234
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:18,660
lake and they want to know you know how
 

3235
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:19,880
lake and they want to know you know how
big is the lake

3236
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:19,890
big is the lake
 

3237
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:22,729
big is the lake
okay fine in Wolfram language they'll be

3238
01:03:22,729 --> 01:03:22,739
okay fine in Wolfram language they'll be
 

3239
01:03:22,739 --> 01:03:24,499
okay fine in Wolfram language they'll be
doing a systematic computation about

3240
01:03:24,499 --> 01:03:24,509
doing a systematic computation about
 

3241
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:26,660
doing a systematic computation about
lakes in Wisconsin so if there's a lake

3242
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:26,670
lakes in Wisconsin so if there's a lake
 

3243
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:28,400
lakes in Wisconsin so if there's a lake
missing you're gonna get the wrong

3244
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:28,410
missing you're gonna get the wrong
 

3245
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:30,410
missing you're gonna get the wrong
answer and so that's a kind of higher

3246
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:30,420
answer and so that's a kind of higher
 

3247
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:35,329
answer and so that's a kind of higher
level of difficulty okay but the this

3248
01:03:35,329 --> 01:03:35,339
level of difficulty okay but the this
 

3249
01:03:35,339 --> 01:03:37,430
level of difficulty okay but the this
yeah I think you're asking some more

3250
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:37,440
yeah I think you're asking some more
 

3251
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,989
yeah I think you're asking some more
technical questions about ontologies and

3252
01:03:38,989 --> 01:03:38,999
technical questions about ontologies and
 

3253
01:03:38,999 --> 01:03:40,849
technical questions about ontologies and
I can try and answer those actually one

3254
01:03:40,849 --> 01:03:40,859
I can try and answer those actually one
 

3255
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:43,910
I can try and answer those actually one
quick question and you know that's

3256
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:43,920
quick question and you know that's
 

3257
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,140
quick question and you know that's
there's a lot of other questions yes

3258
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:45,150
there's a lot of other questions yes
 

3259
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:47,630
there's a lot of other questions yes
that's right okay all right very much my

3260
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:47,640
that's right okay all right very much my
 

3261
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:50,479
that's right okay all right very much my
cyclist as to the left here I got a

3262
01:03:50,479 --> 01:03:50,489
cyclist as to the left here I got a
 

3263
01:03:50,489 --> 01:03:53,210
cyclist as to the left here I got a
simple question who or what are your key

3264
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:53,220
simple question who or what are your key
 

3265
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:59,569
simple question who or what are your key

01:05:27,319 --> 01:05:27,329
machines and things those are probably
 

3337
01:05:27,329 --> 01:05:29,839
machines and things those are probably
more influential to me than his work on

3338
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:29,849
more influential to me than his work on
 

3339
01:05:29,849 --> 01:05:32,780
more influential to me than his work on
on AI and you know probably

3340
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:32,790
on AI and you know probably
 

3341
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:35,240
on AI and you know probably
I my mistake of not understanding that

3342
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:35,250
I my mistake of not understanding that
 

3343
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:37,340
I my mistake of not understanding that
better but really I would say that I'd

3344
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:37,350
better but really I would say that I'd
 

3345
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:40,790
better but really I would say that I'd
been been rather uninfluenced by by sort

3346
01:05:40,790 --> 01:05:40,800
been been rather uninfluenced by by sort
 

3347
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,860
been been rather uninfluenced by by sort
of the traditional AI kinds of things I

3348
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:42,870
of the traditional AI kinds of things I
 

3349
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:44,090
of the traditional AI kinds of things I
mean it probably hasn't helped that I've

3350
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:44,100
mean it probably hasn't helped that I've
 

3351
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:46,370
mean it probably hasn't helped that I've
kind of lived through a time when when

3352
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:46,380
kind of lived through a time when when
 

3353
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:48,740
kind of lived through a time when when
sort of AI went from you know when I was

3354
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:48,750
sort of AI went from you know when I was
 

3355
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:50,420
sort of AI went from you know when I was
a kid a I was gonna solve everything in

3356
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:50,430
a kid a I was gonna solve everything in
 

3357
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:51,950
a kid a I was gonna solve everything in
the world and then you know it kind of

3358
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:51,960
the world and then you know it kind of
 

3359
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,080
the world and then you know it kind of
decayed for a while and then sort of

3360
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:54,090
decayed for a while and then sort of
 

3361
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:56,750
decayed for a while and then sort of
come back so I so I would say that I can

3362
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:56,760
come back so I so I would say that I can
 

3363
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,790
come back so I so I would say that I can
describe my negative my non influences

3364
01:05:58,790 --> 01:05:58,800
describe my negative my non influences
 

3365
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,410
describe my negative my non influences
better than my impression you gave is

3366
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:00,420
better than my impression you gave is
 

3367
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:02,060
better than my impression you gave is
that you made your own head and it

3368
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:02,070
that you made your own head and it
 

3369
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:03,260
that you made your own head and it
sounds as though that's pretty much

3370
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:03,270
sounds as though that's pretty much
 

3371
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:07,430
sounds as though that's pretty much
right yeah I mean yes I I mean insofar

3372
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:07,440
right yeah I mean yes I I mean insofar
 

3373
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,530
right yeah I mean yes I I mean insofar
as those things to me I mean look things

3374
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:09,540
as those things to me I mean look things
 

3375
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:14,060
as those things to me I mean look things
like the you know okay so for example

3376
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:14,070
like the you know okay so for example
 

3377
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:16,850
like the you know okay so for example
studying simple programs as and trying

3378
01:06:16,850 --> 01:06:16,860
studying simple programs as and trying
 

3379
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:18,290
studying simple programs as and trying
to understand the universe of simple

3380
01:06:18,290 --> 01:06:18,300
to understand the universe of simple
 

3381
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:20,600
to understand the universe of simple
programs actually the personal history

3382
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:20,610
programs actually the personal history
 

3383
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:23,000
programs actually the personal history
of that sort of interesting I mean I you

3384
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:23,010
of that sort of interesting I mean I you
 

3385
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:26,210
of that sort of interesting I mean I you
know I used to do particle physics when

3386
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:26,220
know I used to do particle physics when
 

3387
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:30,170
know I used to do particle physics when
I was a kid basically and then I

3388
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:30,180
I was a kid basically and then I
 

3389
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:31,940
I was a kid basically and then I
actually got interested okay so I'll

3390
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:31,950
actually got interested okay so I'll
 

3391
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:33,200
actually got interested okay so I'll
totally the history of that just as an

3392
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:33,210
totally the history of that just as an
 

3393
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:34,940
totally the history of that just as an
example of how sort of interesting is a

3394
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:34,950
example of how sort of interesting is a
 

3395
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:37,160
example of how sort of interesting is a
sort of history of ideas type thing so I

3396
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:37,170
sort of history of ideas type thing so I
 

3397
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:39,800
sort of history of ideas type thing so I
was interested in in how order arises in

3398
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:39,810
was interested in in how order arises in
 

3399
01:06:39,810 --> 01:06:41,930
was interested in in how order arises in
the universe so you know you start off

3400
01:06:41,930 --> 01:06:41,940
the universe so you know you start off
 

3401
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:44,180
the universe so you know you start off
from the hot Big Bang and then pretty

3402
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:44,190
from the hot Big Bang and then pretty
 

3403
01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:45,770
from the hot Big Bang and then pretty
soon you end up with a bunch of humans

3404
01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:45,780
soon you end up with a bunch of humans
 

3405
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:47,450
soon you end up with a bunch of humans
and galaxies and things like this how

3406
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:47,460
and galaxies and things like this how
 

3407
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:49,520
and galaxies and things like this how
does this happen so I got on just in

3408
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:49,530
does this happen so I got on just in
 

3409
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:51,650
does this happen so I got on just in
that question I was also interested in

3410
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:51,660
that question I was also interested in
 

3411
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:54,560
that question I was also interested in
in things like knowing that works for

3412
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:54,570
in things like knowing that works for
 

3413
01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:57,290
in things like knowing that works for
sort of AI purposes and I thought let me

3414
01:06:57,290 --> 01:06:57,300
sort of AI purposes and I thought let me
 

3415
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:00,590
sort of AI purposes and I thought let me
make a minimal model that encompasses

3416
01:07:00,590 --> 01:07:00,600
make a minimal model that encompasses
 

3417
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,990
make a minimal model that encompasses
sort of how complex things arise from

3418
01:07:02,990 --> 01:07:03,000
sort of how complex things arise from
 

3419
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,920
sort of how complex things arise from
from other stuff and I ended up sort of

3420
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:06,930
from other stuff and I ended up sort of
 

3421
01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:08,270
from other stuff and I ended up sort of
making simpler and simpler and simpler

3422
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:08,280
making simpler and simpler and simpler
 

3423
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,680
making simpler and simpler and simpler
models and eventually wound up with

3424
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:09,690
models and eventually wound up with
 

3425
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:11,720
models and eventually wound up with
cellular automata and which I didn't

3426
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:11,730
cellular automata and which I didn't
 

3427
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:13,160
cellular automata and which I didn't
know were called cellular automata when

3428
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:13,170
know were called cellular automata when
 

3429
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:15,050
know were called cellular automata when
I started looking at them and then found

3430
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:15,060
I started looking at them and then found
 

3431
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:16,880
I started looking at them and then found
they didn't interesting things and the

3432
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:16,890
they didn't interesting things and the
 

3433
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:18,590
they didn't interesting things and the
two areas were cellular automata had

3434
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:18,600
two areas were cellular automata had
 

3435
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:22,340
two areas were cellular automata had
been singularly unuseful in analyzing

3436
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:22,350
been singularly unuseful in analyzing
 

3437
01:07:22,350 --> 01:07:24,650
been singularly unuseful in analyzing
things our large-scale structure in the

3438
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:24,660
things our large-scale structure in the
 

3439
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:27,980
things our large-scale structure in the
universe and neural networks so turned

3440
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:27,990
universe and neural networks so turned
 

3441
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:30,500
universe and neural networks so turned
out but but that by the way the fact

3442
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:30,510
out but but that by the way the fact
 

3443
01:07:30,510 --> 01:07:32,270
out but but that by the way the fact
that I kind of even imagined that one

3444
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:32,280
that I kind of even imagined that one
 

3445
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,610
that I kind of even imagined that one
could just start yeah I should say you

3446
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:34,620
could just start yeah I should say you
 

3447
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:36,620
could just start yeah I should say you
know I've been doing physics and in

3448
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:36,630
know I've been doing physics and in
 

3449
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:39,350
know I've been doing physics and in
physics the kind of intellectual concept

3450
01:07:39,350 --> 01:07:39,360
physics the kind of intellectual concept
 

3451
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:41,330
physics the kind of intellectual concept
is you take the world as it is and you

3452
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:41,340
is you take the world as it is and you
 

3453
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:43,520
is you take the world as it is and you
try and drill down and find out what you

3454
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:43,530
try and drill down and find out what you
 

3455
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:44,780
try and drill down and find out what you
know what makes the world out of

3456
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:44,790
know what makes the world out of
 

3457
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:46,339
know what makes the world out of
primitives and so on it's

3458
01:07:46,339 --> 01:07:46,349
primitives and so on it's
 

3459
01:07:46,349 --> 01:07:49,099
primitives and so on it's
you know reduce to find things then I

3460
01:07:49,099 --> 01:07:49,109
you know reduce to find things then I
 

3461
01:07:49,109 --> 01:07:51,349
you know reduce to find things then I
built my first computer language a thing

3462
01:07:51,349 --> 01:07:51,359
built my first computer language a thing
 

3463
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,420
built my first computer language a thing
called SMP which went the other way

3464
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:53,430
called SMP which went the other way
 

3465
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:54,799
called SMP which went the other way
around where I was just like I'm just

3466
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:54,809
around where I was just like I'm just
 

3467
01:07:54,809 --> 01:07:56,479
around where I was just like I'm just
gonna make up this computer language and

3468
01:07:56,479 --> 01:07:56,489
gonna make up this computer language and
 

3469
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,999
gonna make up this computer language and
you know just make up what I want the

3470
01:07:58,999 --> 01:07:59,009
you know just make up what I want the
 

3471
01:07:59,009 --> 01:08:00,229
you know just make up what I want the
primitives to be and I'm gonna build

3472
01:08:00,229 --> 01:08:00,239
primitives to be and I'm gonna build
 

3473
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:02,479
primitives to be and I'm gonna build
stuff up from it I think that the fact

3474
01:08:02,479 --> 01:08:02,489
stuff up from it I think that the fact
 

3475
01:08:02,489 --> 01:08:04,400
stuff up from it I think that the fact
that I kind of had the idea of doing

3476
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:04,410
that I kind of had the idea of doing
 

3477
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:06,529
that I kind of had the idea of doing
things like making up cellular automata

3478
01:08:06,529 --> 01:08:06,539
things like making up cellular automata
 

3479
01:08:06,539 --> 01:08:08,749
things like making up cellular automata
as possible models for the world was a

3480
01:08:08,749 --> 01:08:08,759
as possible models for the world was a
 

3481
01:08:08,759 --> 01:08:09,949
as possible models for the world was a
consequence of the fact that I worked on

3482
01:08:09,949 --> 01:08:09,959
consequence of the fact that I worked on
 

3483
01:08:09,959 --> 01:08:11,900
consequence of the fact that I worked on
this computer language which was a thing

3484
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:11,910
this computer language which was a thing
 

3485
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:13,370
this computer language which was a thing
which worked the opposite way around

3486
01:08:13,370 --> 01:08:13,380
which worked the opposite way around
 

3487
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:14,689
which worked the opposite way around
from the way that one is used to doing

3488
01:08:14,689 --> 01:08:14,699
from the way that one is used to doing
 

3489
01:08:14,699 --> 01:08:16,700
from the way that one is used to doing
natural science which is sort of this

3490
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:16,710
natural science which is sort of this
 

3491
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:19,430
natural science which is sort of this
reductionist approach and that's I mean

3492
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:19,440
reductionist approach and that's I mean
 

3493
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:21,740
reductionist approach and that's I mean
so that's just an example of it you know

3494
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:21,750
so that's just an example of it you know
 

3495
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:25,280
so that's just an example of it you know
I found I happen to have spent a bunch

3496
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:25,290
I found I happen to have spent a bunch
 

3497
01:08:25,290 --> 01:08:27,709
I found I happen to have spent a bunch
of time studying as I say history of

3498
01:08:27,709 --> 01:08:27,719
of time studying as I say history of
 

3499
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:29,599
of time studying as I say history of
science and one of my one of my hobbies

3500
01:08:29,599 --> 01:08:29,609
science and one of my one of my hobbies
 

3501
01:08:29,609 --> 01:08:32,089
science and one of my one of my hobbies
is sort of history of ideas I even wrote

3502
01:08:32,089 --> 01:08:32,099
is sort of history of ideas I even wrote
 

3503
01:08:32,099 --> 01:08:33,919
is sort of history of ideas I even wrote
this little book called idea makers

3504
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:33,929
this little book called idea makers
 

3505
01:08:33,929 --> 01:08:35,450
this little book called idea makers
which is about biographies of a bunch of

3506
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:35,460
which is about biographies of a bunch of
 

3507
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:36,950
which is about biographies of a bunch of
people who for one reason or another

3508
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:36,960
people who for one reason or another
 

3509
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,140
people who for one reason or another
I've written about and so I'm I'm always

3510
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:39,150
I've written about and so I'm I'm always
 

3511
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:40,579
I've written about and so I'm I'm always
curious about this thing about how do

3512
01:08:40,579 --> 01:08:40,589
curious about this thing about how do
 

3513
01:08:40,589 --> 01:08:42,349
curious about this thing about how do
people actually wind up figuring out the

3514
01:08:42,349 --> 01:08:42,359
people actually wind up figuring out the
 

3515
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:44,839
people actually wind up figuring out the
things they figure out and you know one

3516
01:08:44,839 --> 01:08:44,849
things they figure out and you know one
 

3517
01:08:44,849 --> 01:08:47,749
things they figure out and you know one
of the one of the conclusions of my you

3518
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:47,759
of the one of the conclusions of my you
 

3519
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:49,609
of the one of the conclusions of my you
know investigations of many people is

3520
01:08:49,609 --> 01:08:49,619
know investigations of many people is
 

3521
01:08:49,619 --> 01:08:52,309
know investigations of many people is
there are very rarely moments of

3522
01:08:52,309 --> 01:08:52,319
there are very rarely moments of
 

3523
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:54,490
there are very rarely moments of
inspiration usually it's long

3524
01:08:54,490 --> 01:08:54,500
inspiration usually it's long
 

3525
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:57,319
inspiration usually it's long
multi-decade kinds of things which only

3526
01:08:57,319 --> 01:08:57,329
multi-decade kinds of things which only
 

3527
01:08:57,329 --> 01:08:59,660
multi-decade kinds of things which only
later get compressed into something

3528
01:08:59,660 --> 01:08:59,670
later get compressed into something
 

3529
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:04,120
later get compressed into something
short and also the path is often much

3530
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:04,130
short and also the path is often much
 

3531
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:09,229
short and also the path is often much
you know it's it's it's quite what can I

3532
01:09:09,229 --> 01:09:09,239
you know it's it's it's quite what can I
 

3533
01:09:09,239 --> 01:09:09,680
you know it's it's it's quite what can I
say

3534
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:09,690
say
 

3535
01:09:09,690 --> 01:09:12,499
say
that the steps are quite small and you

3536
01:09:12,499 --> 01:09:12,509
that the steps are quite small and you
 

3537
01:09:12,509 --> 01:09:13,849
that the steps are quite small and you
know but the path is often kind of

3538
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:13,859
know but the path is often kind of
 

3539
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:15,319
know but the path is often kind of
complicated and that's what that's what

3540
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:15,329
complicated and that's what that's what
 

3541
01:09:15,329 --> 01:09:17,030
complicated and that's what that's what
it's been for me so I simple question

3542
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:17,040
it's been for me so I simple question
 

3543
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:23,359
it's been for me so I simple question
complex answer sorry so when I basically

3544
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:23,369
complex answer sorry so when I basically
 

3545
01:09:23,369 --> 01:09:24,890
complex answer sorry so when I basically
see from the Wolfram languages it's a

3546
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:24,900
see from the Wolfram languages it's a
 

3547
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:26,990
see from the Wolfram languages it's a
way to describe all of objective reality

3548
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:27,000
way to describe all of objective reality
 

3549
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,749
way to describe all of objective reality
it's kind of formalizing just about the

3550
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:29,759
it's kind of formalizing just about the
 

3551
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:31,339
it's kind of formalizing just about the
entire domain of discourse use a

3552

entire domain of discourse use a
 

3553
01:09:31,349 --> 01:09:33,050
entire domain of discourse use a
philosophical term and you kind of

3554
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:33,060
philosophical term and you kind of
 

3555
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:35,059
philosophical term and you kind of
hinted at this in your lecture where

3556
01:09:35,059 --> 01:09:35,069
hinted at this in your lecture where
 

3557
01:09:35,069 --> 01:09:36,589
hinted at this in your lecture where
that where it sort of leaves office is

3558
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:36,599
that where it sort of leaves office is
 

3559
01:09:36,599 --> 01:09:37,970
that where it sort of leaves office is
that when we start to talk about more

3560
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:37,980
that when we start to talk about more
 

3561
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:40,609
that when we start to talk about more
esoteric philosophical concepts purpose

3562

esoteric philosophical concepts purpose
 

3563
01:09:40,619 --> 01:09:42,970
esoteric philosophical concepts purpose
I guess this would lean into things like

3564
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:42,980
I guess this would lean into things like
 

3565
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:44,720
I guess this would lean into things like
epistemology because essentially you

3566
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:44,730
epistemology because essentially you
 

3567
01:09:44,730 --> 01:09:46,069
epistemology because essentially you
only have science there and as amazing

only have science there and as amazing
 

3569
01:09:46,079 --> 01:09:47,629
only have science there and as amazing
as Sciences there are other things that

as Sciences there are other things that
 

3571
01:09:47,639 --> 01:09:50,030
as Sciences there are other things that
are talked about not you know you know

are talked about not you know you know
 

3573
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,849

you have an idea of how Wolfram might or
might not be able to branch into those

3578
01:09:57,859 --> 01:09:57,869
might not be able to branch into those
 

3579
01:09:57,869 --> 01:09:59,449
might not be able to branch into those
discourses because I'm

questions to matters of logic he could
have a machine that would basically

3620
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:38,550
have a machine that would basically
 

3621
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:41,330
have a machine that would basically

this but but the point so what he tried
 

3639
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,910
this but but the point so what he tried
to do was to make a formalized

01:11:12,389 --> 01:11:15,109
barren landscape there was this period
of time in the 1600s when people talked

long time in terms of what can we do
 

3665
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:33,199
long time in terms of what can we do
that with you know I've been trying to

3666
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:33,209
that with you know I've been trying to
 

3667
01:11:33,209 --> 01:11:34,729
that with you know I've been trying to
figure out what the best way to do it is

figure out what the best way to do it is

I think it's actually not as hard as one
 

3671

I think it's actually not as hard as one
might think these areas one thing you

3672
01:11:39,049 --> 01:11:39,059
might think these areas one thing you
 

3673
01:11:39,059 --> 01:11:40,339
might think these areas one thing you
have to understand these areas like

3674
01:11:40,339 --> 01:11:40,349
have to understand these areas like
 

3675
01:11:40,349 --> 01:11:42,890
have to understand these areas like
philosophy and so on are they're on the

3676
01:11:42,890 --> 01:11:42,900
philosophy and so on are they're on the
 

3677

in morphing language right now we have a

3684
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:52,110
in morphing language right now we have a
 

3685
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:53,629
in morphing language right now we have a
pretty good description of pieces of

3686
01:11:53,629 --> 01:11:53,639
pretty good description of pieces of
 

3687
01:11:53,639 --> 01:11:55,939
pretty good description of pieces of
chocolate we know all sorts of you know

3688

chocolate we know all sorts of you know
 

3689
01:11:55,949 --> 01:11:57,770
chocolate we know all sorts of you know
we probably know 100 different kinds of

3690
01:11:57,770 --> 01:11:57,780
we probably know 100 different kinds of
 

3691
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:59,689
we probably know 100 different kinds of
chocolate we know how big the pieces are

3692
01:11:59,689 --> 01:11:59,699
chocolate we know how big the pieces are
 

3693
01:11:59,699 --> 01:12:02,359
chocolate we know how big the pieces are
all that kind of thing the I want part

3694
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:02,369
all that kind of thing the I want part
 

3695
01:12:02,369 --> 01:12:03,949
all that kind of thing the I want part
of that sentence we can't do that right

3696
01:12:03,949 --> 01:12:03,959
of that sentence we can't do that right
 

3697
01:12:03,959 --> 01:12:06,560
of that sentence we can't do that right
now but I don't think that's that hard

3698
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:06,570
now but I don't think that's that hard
 

3699
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:10,489
now but I don't think that's that hard
and I'm you know that's now if you ask

3700
01:12:10,489 --> 01:12:10,499
and I'm you know that's now if you ask
 

3701
01:12:10,499 --> 01:12:13,160
and I'm you know that's now if you ask
let's say we had I think the different

01:12:15,169 --> 01:12:15,179
thing you're saying is let's say we had
 

3705
01:12:15,179 --> 01:12:18,049
thing you're saying is let's say we had
the omnipotent AI so to speak that was

3706
01:12:18,049 --> 01:12:18,059
the omnipotent AI so to speak that was
 

3707
01:12:18,059 --> 01:12:20,270
the omnipotent AI so to speak that was
able to you know where we turn over the

3708
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:20,280
able to you know where we turn over the
 

3709
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:22,189
able to you know where we turn over the
control of the central bank to the AI we

3710
01:12:22,189 --> 01:12:22,199
control of the central bank to the AI we
 

3711
01:12:22,199 --> 01:12:23,930
control of the central bank to the AI we
turn over all these other things to the

3712
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:23,940
turn over all these other things to the
 

3713
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:26,000
turn over all these other things to the
AI then the question is we say to the AI

3714
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:26,010
AI then the question is we say to the AI
 

3715
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:30,080
AI then the question is we say to the AI
now do the right thing and then the

3716
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:30,090
now do the right thing and then the
 

3717
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:32,149
now do the right thing and then the
problem with that is and this is why I

3718
01:12:32,149 --> 01:12:32,159
problem with that is and this is why I
 

3719
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:33,680
problem with that is and this is why I
talk about you know creating AI

3720
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:33,690
talk about you know creating AI
 

3721
01:12:33,690 --> 01:12:36,580
talk about you know creating AI
constitutions and so on we have

3722
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:36,590
constitutions and so on we have
 

3723
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:38,750
constitutions and so on we have
absolutely no idea what do the right

3724
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:38,760
absolutely no idea what do the right
 

3725
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:39,830
absolutely no idea what do the right
thing is supposed to mean and

3726
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:39,840
thing is supposed to mean and
 

3727
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,060
thing is supposed to mean and
philosophers have been arguing about

3728
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:41,070
philosophers have been arguing about
 

3729
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:42,770
philosophers have been arguing about
that you know utilitarianism is an

3730
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:42,780
that you know utilitarianism is an
 

3731
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:45,830
that you know utilitarianism is an
example of that of one of the answers to

3732
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:45,840
example of that of one of the answers to
 

3733
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,330
example of that of one of the answers to
that although it's not a complete answer

3734
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:47,340
that although it's not a complete answer
 

3735
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:49,160
that although it's not a complete answer
by any means it's not not really an

3736
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:49,170
by any means it's not not really an
 

3737
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:50,450
by any means it's not not really an
answer it's just a way of posing the

3738
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:50,460
answer it's just a way of posing the
 

3739
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:53,270
answer it's just a way of posing the
question and so I think that the you

3740
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:53,280
question and so I think that the you
 

3741
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,509
question and so I think that the you
know one of one of the features of so I

3742
01:12:56,509 --> 01:12:56,519
know one of one of the features of so I
 

3743
01:12:56,519 --> 01:12:59,359
know one of one of the features of so I
think it's a really hard problem to you

3744
01:12:59,359 --> 01:12:59,369
think it's a really hard problem to you
 

3745
01:12:59,369 --> 01:13:01,489
think it's a really hard problem to you
know you think to yourself what should

3746
01:13:01,489 --> 01:13:01,499
know you think to yourself what should
 

3747
01:13:01,499 --> 01:13:03,529
know you think to yourself what should
the AI Constitution actually say so

3748
01:13:03,529 --> 01:13:03,539
the AI Constitution actually say so
 

3749
01:13:03,539 --> 01:13:05,000
the AI Constitution actually say so
first thing you might think is oh

3750
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:05,010
first thing you might think is oh
 

3751
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:06,620
first thing you might think is oh
there's going to be you know something

3752
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:06,630
there's going to be you know something
 

3753
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:08,270
there's going to be you know something
like Asimov's laws of robotics there's

3754
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:08,280
like Asimov's laws of robotics there's
 

3755
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:10,819
like Asimov's laws of robotics there's
going to be one you know golden rule for

3756
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:10,829
going to be one you know golden rule for
 

3757
01:13:10,829 --> 01:13:13,609
going to be one you know golden rule for
a eyes and if we just follow that golden

3758
01:13:13,609 --> 01:13:13,619
a eyes and if we just follow that golden
 

3759
01:13:13,619 --> 01:13:17,080
a eyes and if we just follow that golden
rule all well okay I think that that is

3760
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:17,090
rule all well okay I think that that is
 

3761
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:19,279
rule all well okay I think that that is
absolutely impossible and in fact I

3762
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:19,289
absolutely impossible and in fact I
 

3763
01:13:19,289 --> 01:13:20,060
absolutely impossible and in fact I
think you can even sort of

3764
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:20,070
think you can even sort of
 

3765
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:21,799
think you can even sort of
mathematically prove that that's

3766
01:13:21,799 --> 01:13:21,809
mathematically prove that that's
 

3767
01:13:21,809 --> 01:13:23,839
mathematically prove that that's
impossible because I think as soon as

3768
01:13:23,839 --> 01:13:23,849
impossible because I think as soon as
 

3769
01:13:23,849 --> 01:13:26,390
impossible because I think as soon as
you have a system that you know

3770
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:26,400
you have a system that you know
 

3771
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,859
you have a system that you know
essentially what you're trying to do is

3772
01:13:27,859 --> 01:13:27,869
essentially what you're trying to do is
 

3773
01:13:27,869 --> 01:13:31,000
essentially what you're trying to do is
you're trying to put in constraints that

3774
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:31,010
you're trying to put in constraints that
 

3775
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:33,259
you're trying to put in constraints that
okay basically as soon as you have a

3776
01:13:33,259 --> 01:13:33,269
okay basically as soon as you have a
 

3777
01:13:33,269 --> 01:13:34,640
okay basically as soon as you have a
system that shows computational

3778
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:34,650
system that shows computational
 

3779
01:13:34,650 --> 01:13:37,040
system that shows computational
irreducibility I think it is inevitable

3780
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:37,050
irreducibility I think it is inevitable
 

3781
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:40,189
irreducibility I think it is inevitable
that you have ace of have unintended

3782
01:13:40,189 --> 01:13:40,199
that you have ace of have unintended
 

3783
01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:42,680
that you have ace of have unintended
consequences of things which means that

3784
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:42,690
consequences of things which means that
 

3785
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:45,379
consequences of things which means that
you never get to just say put everything

3786
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:45,389
you never get to just say put everything
 

3787
01:13:45,389 --> 01:13:48,020
you never get to just say put everything
in this one very nice box you always

3788
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:48,030
in this one very nice box you always
 

3789
01:13:48,030 --> 01:13:49,640
in this one very nice box you always
have to say let's put in a patch here

3790
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:49,650
have to say let's put in a patch here
 

3791
01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:51,259
have to say let's put in a patch here
let's put in a patch there and so on a

3792
01:13:51,259 --> 01:13:51,269
let's put in a patch there and so on a
 

3793
01:13:51,269 --> 01:13:52,969
let's put in a patch there and so on a
version of this much more abstract

3794
01:13:52,969 --> 01:13:52,979
version of this much more abstract
 

3795
01:13:52,979 --> 01:13:55,459
version of this much more abstract
version of this of girdles theorem so

3796
01:13:55,459 --> 01:13:55,469
version of this of girdles theorem so
 

3797
01:13:55,469 --> 01:13:58,250
version of this of girdles theorem so
girdles theorem is you know it starts up

3798
01:13:58,250 --> 01:13:58,260
girdles theorem is you know it starts up
 

3799
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:01,459
girdles theorem is you know it starts up
by taking the you know it's girls

3800
01:14:01,459 --> 01:14:01,469
by taking the you know it's girls
 

3801
01:14:01,469 --> 01:14:03,919
by taking the you know it's girls
theorem is trying to talk about integers

3802
01:14:03,919 --> 01:14:03,929
theorem is trying to talk about integers
 

3803
01:14:03,929 --> 01:14:06,680
theorem is trying to talk about integers
it says start off with piano's axioms

3804
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:06,690
it says start off with piano's axioms
 

3805
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:09,229
it says start off with piano's axioms
turner's axioms you might say in piano

3806
01:14:09,229 --> 01:14:09,239
turner's axioms you might say in piano
 

3807
01:14:09,239 --> 01:14:11,660
turner's axioms you might say in piano
thought describe the integers and

3808
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:11,670
thought describe the integers and
 

3809
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:13,700
thought describe the integers and
nothing but the integers okay so

3810
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:13,710
nothing but the integers okay so
 

3811
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:16,640
nothing but the integers okay so
anything that's provable from pianos

3812
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:16,650
anything that's provable from pianos
 

3813
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:18,319
anything that's provable from pianos
axioms will be true about integers and

3814
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:18,329
axioms will be true about integers and
 

3815
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:19,549
axioms will be true about integers and
vice-versa okay

3816
01:14:19,549 --> 01:14:19,559
vice-versa okay
 

3817
01:14:19,559 --> 01:14:21,500
vice-versa okay
what girls theorem shows is that you can

3818
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:21,510
what girls theorem shows is that you can
 

3819
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:23,359
what girls theorem shows is that you can
that will never work that there are an

3820
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:23,369
that will never work that there are an
 

3821
01:14:23,369 --> 01:14:24,260
that will never work that there are an
infinite

3822
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:24,270
infinite
 

3823
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:25,940
infinite
hierarchy of patches that you have to

3824
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:25,950
hierarchy of patches that you have to
 

3825
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:28,460
hierarchy of patches that you have to
put on two pianos axioms if you want to

3826
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:28,470
put on two pianos axioms if you want to
 

3827
01:14:28,470 --> 01:14:29,840
put on two pianos axioms if you want to
describe the integers and nothing about

3828
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:29,850
describe the integers and nothing about
 

3829
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:31,640
describe the integers and nothing about
the integers and I think the same is

3830
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:31,650
the integers and I think the same is
 

3831
01:14:31,650 --> 01:14:33,650
the integers and I think the same is
true if you want to have a legal system

3832
01:14:33,650 --> 01:14:33,660
true if you want to have a legal system
 

3833
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:36,560
true if you want to have a legal system
effectively that has no bizarre

3834
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:36,570
effectively that has no bizarre
 

3835
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:38,240
effectively that has no bizarre
unintended consequences so I don't think

3836
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:38,250
unintended consequences so I don't think
 

3837
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:40,340
unintended consequences so I don't think
it's possible to just say you know if

3838
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:40,350
it's possible to just say you know if
 

3839
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:42,680
it's possible to just say you know if
you when you're describing something in

3840
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:42,690
you when you're describing something in
 

3841
01:14:42,690 --> 01:14:43,850
you when you're describing something in
the world that's complicated like I

3842
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:43,860
the world that's complicated like I
 

3843
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:45,620
the world that's complicated like I
don't think it's possible to just have a

3844
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:45,630
don't think it's possible to just have a
 

3845
01:14:45,630 --> 01:14:49,250
don't think it's possible to just have a
small set of rules that will always do

3846
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:49,260
small set of rules that will always do
 

3847
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:50,630
small set of rules that will always do
what we want so to speak I think it's

3848
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:50,640
what we want so to speak I think it's
 

3849
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,100
what we want so to speak I think it's
inevitable that you have to have a long

3850
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:52,110
inevitable that you have to have a long
 

3851
01:14:52,110 --> 01:14:55,430
inevitable that you have to have a long
essentially code of laws and that's what

3852
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:55,440
essentially code of laws and that's what
 

3853
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,110
essentially code of laws and that's what
you know so my guess is that what will

3854
01:14:57,110 --> 01:14:57,120
you know so my guess is that what will
 

3855
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,940
you know so my guess is that what will
actually have to happen is you know as

3856
01:14:58,940 --> 01:14:58,950
actually have to happen is you know as
 

3857
01:14:58,950 --> 01:15:00,560
actually have to happen is you know as
we try and describe what you want the

3858
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:00,570
we try and describe what you want the
 

3859
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:03,230
we try and describe what you want the
eyes to do you know I don't know the

3860
01:15:03,230 --> 01:15:03,240
eyes to do you know I don't know the
 

3861
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,090
eyes to do you know I don't know the
socio-political aspects of how we'll

3862
01:15:05,090 --> 01:15:05,100
socio-political aspects of how we'll
 

3863
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,850
socio-political aspects of how we'll
figure out whether it's 1 AI

3864
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:07,860
figure out whether it's 1 AI
 

3865
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:12,410
figure out whether it's 1 AI
Constitution or 1 per you know city or

3866
01:15:12,410 --> 01:15:12,420
Constitution or 1 per you know city or
 

3867
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:14,930
Constitution or 1 per you know city or
whatever we can talk about that that's a

3868
01:15:14,930 --> 01:15:14,940
whatever we can talk about that that's a
 

3869
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:17,210
whatever we can talk about that that's a
separate issue but but um you know I

3870
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:17,220
separate issue but but um you know I
 

3871
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:18,740
separate issue but but um you know I
think what will happen is it'll be much

3872
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:18,750
think what will happen is it'll be much
 

3873
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:20,420
think what will happen is it'll be much
like human laws it'll be a complicated

3874
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:20,430
like human laws it'll be a complicated
 

3875
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:21,860
like human laws it'll be a complicated
thing that gets progressively patched

3876
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:21,870
thing that gets progressively patched
 

3877
01:15:21,870 --> 01:15:24,200
thing that gets progressively patched
and so I think it's it's some and these

3878
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:24,210
and so I think it's it's some and these
 

3879
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:27,560
and so I think it's it's some and these
ideas like you know oh we'll just make

3880
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:27,570
ideas like you know oh we'll just make
 

3881
01:15:27,570 --> 01:15:29,660
ideas like you know oh we'll just make
the eyes you know run the world

3882
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:29,670
the eyes you know run the world
 

3883
01:15:29,670 --> 01:15:33,020
the eyes you know run the world
according to you know Mills you know

3884
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:33,030
according to you know Mills you know
 

3885
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:35,900
according to you know Mills you know
John Stuart Mill's idea it's not gonna

3886
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:35,910
John Stuart Mill's idea it's not gonna
 

3887
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:38,660
John Stuart Mill's idea it's not gonna
work which is not surprising this

3888
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:38,670
work which is not surprising this
 

3889
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:40,940

philosophy has has has made the point

3890
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:40,950
philosophy has has has made the point
 

3891
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:42,290
philosophy has has has made the point
that it's not as easy it's not an easy

3892
01:15:42,290 --> 01:15:42,300
that it's not as easy it's not an easy
 

3893

01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:45,840
and they're right it's not an easy
 

3897
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:50,600
and they're right it's not an easy
problem thank you yeah I you're talking

3898
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:50,610
problem thank you yeah I you're talking
 

3899
01:15:50,610 --> 01:15:53,600
problem thank you yeah I you're talking
about computational irreducibility and

3900
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:53,610
about computational irreducibility and
 

3901
01:15:53,610 --> 01:15:56,000
about computational irreducibility and
computational equivalents and also that

3902
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:56,010
computational equivalents and also that
 

3903
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:57,980

01:16:03,410 --> 01:16:03,420
physics and things like that I've heard
 

3909
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:05,690

you make the comment before in other

3910
01:16:05,690 --> 01:16:05,700
you make the comment before in other
 

3911
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:09,130
you make the comment before in other
contexts that things like molecules

3912
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:09,140
contexts that things like molecules
 

3913
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:11,810
contexts that things like molecules
compute and I was just ask you exactly

3914
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:11,820
compute and I was just ask you exactly
 

3915
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:13,490
compute and I was just ask you exactly
you you know what you mean by that in

3916
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:13,500
you you know what you mean by that in
 

3917
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:19,970
you you know what you mean by that in
what sense does a molecule I mean what

3918
01:16:19,970 --> 01:16:19,980
what sense does a molecule I mean what
 

3919
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:21,560
what sense does a molecule I mean what
would you like to compute so to speak I

3920
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:21,570
would you like to compute so to speak I
 

3921
01:16:21,570 --> 01:16:24,560
would you like to compute so to speak I
mean in other words you what what is the

3922
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:24,570
mean in other words you what what is the
 

3923
01:16:24,570 --> 01:16:28,190
mean in other words you what what is the
case is that you know one definition of

3924
01:16:28,190 --> 01:16:28,200
case is that you know one definition of
 

3925
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,110
case is that you know one definition of
you're computing is given a particular

3926
01:16:30,110 --> 01:16:30,120
you're computing is given a particular
 

3927
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,820
you're computing is given a particular
computation like I don't know finding

3928
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:31,830
computation like I don't know finding
 

3929
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:34,160
computation like I don't know finding
square roots or something you know you

3930
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:34,170
square roots or something you know you
 

3931
01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:36,820
square roots or something you know you
can program a you know

3932
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:36,830
can program a you know
 

3933
01:16:36,830 --> 01:16:39,160
can program a you know
the surprising thing is that an awful

3934
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:39,170
the surprising thing is that an awful
 

3935
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:42,160
the surprising thing is that an awful
lot of stuff can be programmed to do any

3936
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:42,170
lot of stuff can be programmed to do any
 

3937
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:45,760
lot of stuff can be programmed to do any
computation you want that's some and you

3938
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:45,770
computation you want that's some and you
 

3939
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:47,410
computation you want that's some and you
know when it comes to I mean I think for

3940
01:16:47,410 --> 01:16:47,420
know when it comes to I mean I think for
 

3941
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:48,880
know when it comes to I mean I think for
example when you look at nanotechnology

3942
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:48,890
example when you look at nanotechnology
 

3943
01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:52,570
example when you look at nanotechnology
and so on the the current you know one

3944
01:16:52,570 --> 01:16:52,580
and so on the the current you know one
 

3945
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:54,940
and so on the the current you know one
of the current beliefs says to make very

3946
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:54,950
of the current beliefs says to make very
 

3947
01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:57,610
of the current beliefs says to make very
small computers you should take what we

3948
01:16:57,610 --> 01:16:57,620
small computers you should take what we
 

3949
01:16:57,620 --> 01:16:59,590
small computers you should take what we
know about making big computers and just

3950
01:16:59,590 --> 01:16:59,600
know about making big computers and just
 

3951
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:02,920
know about making big computers and just
you know make them smaller so to speak I

3952
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:02,930
you know make them smaller so to speak I
 

3953
01:17:02,930 --> 01:17:04,930
you know make them smaller so to speak I
don't think that's the approach you have

3954
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:04,940
don't think that's the approach you have
 

3955
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:06,640
don't think that's the approach you have
to use I think you can take the

3956
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:06,650
to use I think you can take the
 

3957
01:17:06,650 --> 01:17:08,080
to use I think you can take the
components that exist at the level of

3958
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:08,090
components that exist at the level of
 

3959
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:11,260
components that exist at the level of
molecules and say how do we assemble

3960
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:11,270
molecules and say how do we assemble
 

3961
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:13,450
molecules and say how do we assemble
those components to be able to do

3962
01:17:13,450 --> 01:17:13,460
those components to be able to do
 

3963
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:14,710
those components to be able to do
complicated computations I mean it's

3964
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:14,720
complicated computations I mean it's
 

3965
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:17,050
complicated computations I mean it's
like the cellular automata that the you

3966
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:17,060
like the cellular automata that the you
 

3967
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:20,050
like the cellular automata that the you
know the underlying rule for the

3968
01:17:20,050 --> 01:17:20,060
know the underlying rule for the
 

3969
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:22,170
know the underlying rule for the
cellular automaton is very simple yet

3970
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:22,180
cellular automaton is very simple yet
 

3971
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:24,850
cellular automaton is very simple yet
when that rule is applied many times it

3972
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:24,860
when that rule is applied many times it
 

3973
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:27,010
when that rule is applied many times it
can do a sophisticated computation so I

3974
01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:27,020
can do a sophisticated computation so I
 

3975
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:28,780
can do a sophisticated computation so I
think that that's the that's the sense

3976
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:28,790
think that that's the that's the sense
 

3977
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:32,590
think that that's the that's the sense
in which what can I say the raw material

3978
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:32,600
in which what can I say the raw material
 

3979
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:36,190
in which what can I say the raw material
that you need for computation can be you

3980
01:17:36,190 --> 01:17:36,200
that you need for computation can be you
 

3981
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,510
that you need for computation can be you
know there's a great diversity in the

3982
01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:37,520
know there's a great diversity in the
 

3983
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,800
know there's a great diversity in the
raw material that you can use for

3984
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:38,810
raw material that you can use for
 

3985
01:17:38,810 --> 01:17:40,840
raw material that you can use for
computation our particular human

3986
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:40,850

01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:44,000
development you know stack of of
 

3989
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,700

01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:45,710
technologies that we use for computation
 

3991
01:17:45,710 --> 01:17:47,200
technologies that we use for computation
right now is just one particular path

3992
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:47,210
right now is just one particular path
 

3993
01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:49,630
right now is just one particular path
and we can you know so a very practical

3994
01:17:49,630 --> 01:17:49,640
and we can you know so a very practical
 

3995
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,150
and we can you know so a very practical
example of this is algorithmic drugs so

3996
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:52,160
example of this is algorithmic drugs so
 

3997
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,980
example of this is algorithmic drugs so
the question is right now drugs pretty

3998
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:53,990
the question is right now drugs pretty
 

3999
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:56,530
the question is right now drugs pretty
much work by most drugs work well you

4000
01:17:56,530 --> 01:17:56,540
much work by most drugs work well you
 

4001
01:17:56,540 --> 01:17:57,790
much work by most drugs work well you
know there is a binding site and a

4002
01:17:57,790 --> 01:17:57,800
know there is a binding site and a
 

4003
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,560
know there is a binding site and a
molecule drug fits into binding site

does something question is can you

4006
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:01,940
does something question is can you
 

4007
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:03,760
does something question is can you
imagine having something where the

4008
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:03,770
imagine having something where the
 

4009
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:05,950
imagine having something where the
molecule you know is something which has

01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:10,750
computations going on in it where it
goes around and it looks at that you

4014
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:10,760
goes around and it looks at that you
 

4015
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:11,980
goes around and it looks at that you
know that thing it's supposed to be

4016
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:11,990
know that thing it's supposed to be
 

4017
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:13,570
know that thing it's supposed to be
binding to and it figures out oh there's

4018
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:13,580
binding to and it figures out oh there's
 

4019
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:15,760
binding to and it figures out oh there's
this knob here and that knob there it

4020
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:15,770
this knob here and that knob there it
 

4021
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:18,010
this knob here and that knob there it
reconfigures itself it's computing

4022
01:18:18,010 --> 01:18:18,020
reconfigures itself it's computing
 

4023
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:20,050
reconfigures itself it's computing
something it's trying to figure out you

4024
01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:20,060
something it's trying to figure out you
 

4025
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:21,610
something it's trying to figure out you
know is this likely to be a tumor cell

4026
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:21,620
know is this likely to be a tumor cell
 

4027
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:23,380
know is this likely to be a tumor cell
or whatever based on some more

4028
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:23,390
or whatever based on some more
 

4029
01:18:23,390 --> 01:18:25,330
or whatever based on some more
complicated thing that's the type of

4030
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:25,340
complicated thing that's the type of
 

4031
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:27,250
complicated thing that's the type of
thing that I mean by by computations

4032
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:27,260
thing that I mean by by computations
 

4033
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:29,230
thing that I mean by by computations
happening at an R color scale okay I

4034
01:18:29,230 --> 01:18:29,240
happening at an R color scale okay I
 

4035
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,720
happening at an R color scale okay I
guess I meant to ask if it follows from

4036
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:31,730
guess I meant to ask if it follows from
 

4037
01:18:31,730 --> 01:18:34,900
guess I meant to ask if it follows from
that if in your view like the the

4038
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:34,910
that if in your view like the the
 

4039
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:37,090
that if in your view like the the
molecules in the chalkboard and in my

4040
01:18:37,090 --> 01:18:37,100
molecules in the chalkboard and in my
 

4041
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:39,130
molecules in the chalkboard and in my
face and in the table are in any sense

4042
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:39,140
face and in the table are in any sense
 

4043
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:41,890
face and in the table are in any sense
currently during doing computer I mean

4044
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:41,900
currently during doing computer I mean
 

4045
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:43,120
currently during doing computer I mean
the question of what computation look

4046
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:43,130
the question of what computation look
 

4047
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:44,950
the question of what computation look
one of the things to realize if you look

4048
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:44,960
one of the things to realize if you look
 

4049
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,140
one of the things to realize if you look
at kind of the sort of past and future

4050
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:47,150
at kind of the sort of past and future
 

4051
01:18:47,150 --> 01:18:50,169
at kind of the sort of past and future
of things the the

4052
01:18:50,169 --> 01:18:50,179
of things the the
 

4053
01:18:50,179 --> 01:18:52,030
of things the the
okay so here's an observation actually I

4054
01:18:52,030 --> 01:18:52,040
okay so here's an observation actually I
 

4055
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:54,250
okay so here's an observation actually I
was about light nets actually and

4056
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:54,260
was about light nets actually and
 

4057
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:56,760
was about light nets actually and
lightning says time live Nets made a

4058
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:56,770
lightning says time live Nets made a
 

4059
01:18:56,770 --> 01:18:59,200
lightning says time live Nets made a
calculator type computer out of brass

4060
01:18:59,200 --> 01:18:59,210
calculator type computer out of brass
 

4061
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:02,350
calculator type computer out of brass
took him 30 years okay so in his day

4062
01:19:02,350 --> 01:19:02,360
took him 30 years okay so in his day
 

4063
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:05,110
took him 30 years okay so in his day
there was you know at most one computer

4064
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:05,120
there was you know at most one computer
 

4065
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,220
there was you know at most one computer
in the world as far as he was concerned

4066
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:06,230
in the world as far as he was concerned
 

4067
01:19:06,230 --> 01:19:08,530
in the world as far as he was concerned
right today's world there may be 10

4068
01:19:08,530 --> 01:19:08,540
right today's world there may be 10
 

4069
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:10,300
right today's world there may be 10
billion computers maybe 20 billion

4070
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:10,310
billion computers maybe 20 billion
 

4071
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:12,250
billion computers maybe 20 billion
computers I don't know the question is

4072
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:12,260
computers I don't know the question is
 

4073
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:13,270
computers I don't know the question is
what's that going to look like in the

4074
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:13,280
what's that going to look like in the
 

4075
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:16,209
what's that going to look like in the
future and I think the answer is that in

4076
01:19:16,209 --> 01:19:16,219
future and I think the answer is that in
 

4077
01:19:16,219 --> 01:19:19,270
future and I think the answer is that in
time probably everything we have will be

4078
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:19,280
time probably everything we have will be
 

4079
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,550
time probably everything we have will be
made of computers in the following sense

4080
01:19:21,550 --> 01:19:21,560
made of computers in the following sense
 

4081
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:23,680
made of computers in the following sense
that basically it won't be you know in

4082
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:23,690
that basically it won't be you know in
 

4083
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:25,240
that basically it won't be you know in
today's world things are made of you

4084
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:25,250
today's world things are made of you
 

4085
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:27,520
today's world things are made of you
know metal plastic whatever else but

4086
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:27,530
know metal plastic whatever else but
 

4087
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:29,680
know metal plastic whatever else but
actually that won't make it there won't

4088
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:29,690
actually that won't make it there won't
 

4089
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:31,390
actually that won't make it there won't
be any point in doing that once we know

4090
01:19:31,390 --> 01:19:31,400
be any point in doing that once we know
 

4091
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,459
be any point in doing that once we know
how to do you know molecular scale

4092
01:19:33,459 --> 01:19:33,469
how to do you know molecular scale
 

4093
01:19:33,469 --> 01:19:35,649
how to do you know molecular scale
manufacturing and so on we might as well

4094
01:19:35,649 --> 01:19:35,659
manufacturing and so on we might as well
 

4095
01:19:35,659 --> 01:19:37,240
manufacturing and so on we might as well
just make everything out of programmable

4096
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:37,250
just make everything out of programmable
 

4097
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:39,970
just make everything out of programmable
stuff and I think that's a that's a

4098
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:39,980
stuff and I think that's a that's a
 

4099
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:42,970
stuff and I think that's a that's a
sense in which you know the the and you

4100
01:19:42,970 --> 01:19:42,980
sense in which you know the the and you
 

4101
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:44,500
sense in which you know the the and you
know the one example we have molecular

4102
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:44,510
know the one example we have molecular
 

4103
01:19:44,510 --> 01:19:46,840
know the one example we have molecular
computing right now is us bio in biology

4104
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:46,850
computing right now is us bio in biology
 

4105
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:49,540
computing right now is us bio in biology
you know biology does a reasonable job

4106
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:49,550
you know biology does a reasonable job
 

4107
01:19:49,550 --> 01:19:51,510
you know biology does a reasonable job
of specific kinds of molecular computing

4108
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:51,520
of specific kinds of molecular computing
 

4109
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,830
of specific kinds of molecular computing
it's kind of embarrassing I think that

4110
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:53,840
it's kind of embarrassing I think that
 

4111
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:56,200
it's kind of embarrassing I think that
the only you know molecule we know that

4112
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:56,210
the only you know molecule we know that
 

4113
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:58,479
the only you know molecule we know that
sort of a memory molecule is DNA that's

4114
01:19:58,479 --> 01:19:58,489
sort of a memory molecule is DNA that's
 

4115
01:19:58,489 --> 01:20:00,189
sort of a memory molecule is DNA that's
kind of you know which is kind of the

4116
01:20:00,189 --> 01:20:00,199
kind of you know which is kind of the
 

4117
01:20:00,199 --> 01:20:01,540
kind of you know which is kind of the
you know the particular biological

4118
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:01,550
you know the particular biological
 

4119
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:03,700
you know the particular biological
solution in time we'll know lots of

4120
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:03,710
solution in time we'll know lots of
 

4121
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:07,060
solution in time we'll know lots of
others and you know I think the the sort

4122
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:07,070
others and you know I think the the sort
 

4123
01:20:07,070 --> 01:20:09,580
others and you know I think the the sort
of the the end point is so if you're

4124
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:09,590
of the the end point is so if you're
 

4125
01:20:09,590 --> 01:20:12,189
of the the end point is so if you're
asking is you know is computation going

4126
01:20:12,189 --> 01:20:12,199
asking is you know is computation going
 

4127
01:20:12,199 --> 01:20:14,080
asking is you know is computation going
on in you know in this water bottle the

4128
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:14,090
on in you know in this water bottle the
 

4129
01:20:14,090 --> 01:20:16,360
on in you know in this water bottle the
answer is absolutely it's probably even

4130
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:16,370
answer is absolutely it's probably even
 

4131
01:20:16,370 --> 01:20:18,070
answer is absolutely it's probably even
many aspects of that computation are

4132
01:20:18,070 --> 01:20:18,080
many aspects of that computation are
 

4133
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,330
many aspects of that computation are
pretty sophisticated if we wanted to

4134
01:20:19,330 --> 01:20:19,340
pretty sophisticated if we wanted to
 

4135
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:20,830
pretty sophisticated if we wanted to
know what would happen to particular

4136
01:20:20,830 --> 01:20:20,840
know what would happen to particular
 

4137
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:22,390
know what would happen to particular
molecules here it's going to be hard to

4138
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:22,400
molecules here it's going to be hard to
 

4139
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,220
molecules here it's going to be hard to
tell there's going to be computational

4140
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:24,230
tell there's going to be computational
 

4141
01:20:24,230 --> 01:20:26,470
tell there's going to be computational
irreducibility and so on can we make use

4142
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:26,480
irreducibility and so on can we make use
 

4143
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,930
irreducibility and so on can we make use
of that for our human purposes can we

4144
01:20:28,930 --> 01:20:28,940
of that for our human purposes can we
 

4145
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:30,520
of that for our human purposes can we
piggyback on that to achieve something

4146
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:30,530
piggyback on that to achieve something
 

4147
01:20:30,530 --> 01:20:32,680
piggyback on that to achieve something
technological that's different issue and

4148
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:32,690
technological that's different issue and
 

4149
01:20:32,690 --> 01:20:34,750
technological that's different issue and
that's the four that we have to build up

4150
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:34,760
that's the four that we have to build up
 

4151
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:37,060
that's the four that we have to build up
this whole sort of chain of technology

4152
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:37,070
this whole sort of chain of technology
 

4153
01:20:37,070 --> 01:20:39,310
this whole sort of chain of technology
to be able to connect it which is what

4154
01:20:39,310 --> 01:20:39,320
to be able to connect it which is what
 

4155
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:41,290
to be able to connect it which is what
I've kind of been been keep on talking

4156
01:20:41,290 --> 01:20:41,300
I've kind of been been keep on talking
 

4157
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:44,169
I've kind of been been keep on talking
about is how do we connect sort of what

4158
01:20:44,169 --> 01:20:44,179
about is how do we connect sort of what
 

4159
01:20:44,179 --> 01:20:45,790
about is how do we connect sort of what
is possible computationally in the

4160
01:20:45,790 --> 01:20:45,800
is possible computationally in the
 

4161
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,939
is possible computationally in the
universe to what we humans can kind of

4162
01:20:48,939 --> 01:20:48,949
universe to what we humans can kind of
 

4163
01:20:48,949 --> 01:20:50,410
universe to what we humans can kind of
conceptualize that we want to do in

4164
01:20:50,410 --> 01:20:50,420
conceptualize that we want to do in
 

4165
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:52,030
conceptualize that we want to do in
computation and that's you know that's

01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:52,040
computation and that's you know that's
 

4167
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:53,350
computation and that's you know that's
the bridge that we have to make and

4168
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:53,360
the bridge that we have to make and
 

4169
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:54,970
the bridge that we have to make and
that's the hard part but getting the

01:20:54,970 --> 01:20:54,980
that's the hard part but getting the
 

4171

that's the hard part but getting the
intrinsic getting the computation done

intrinsic getting the computation done
 

4173
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:59,590
intrinsic getting the computation done
is is you know there's computation going

4174
01:20:59,590 --> 01:20:59,600
is is you know there's computation going
 

4175

is is you know there's computation going
on all over the place there may be a

4176
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:02,659
on all over the place there may be a
 

4177
01:21:02,659 --> 01:21:03,700
on all over the place there may be a
couple more questions

4178
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:03,710
couple more questions
 

4179
01:21:03,710 --> 01:21:07,120
couple more questions
I was hoping you could elaborate on what

4180
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:07,130
I was hoping you could elaborate on what
 

4181
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:09,100
I was hoping you could elaborate on what
you're talking about earlier of like

4182
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:09,110
you're talking about earlier of like
 

4183
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:11,650
you're talking about earlier of like
searching the entire space of possible

4184
01:21:11,650 --> 01:21:11,660
searching the entire space of possible
 

4185
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:15,040
searching the entire space of possible
programs so that's very broad so maybe

4186
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:15,050
programs so that's very broad so maybe
 

4187
01:21:15,050 --> 01:21:18,370
programs so that's very broad so maybe
like what kind of searching of that

4188
01:21:18,370 --> 01:21:18,380
like what kind of searching of that
 

4189
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:19,990
like what kind of searching of that
space we're good at and like what we're

4190
01:21:19,990 --> 01:21:20,000
space we're good at and like what we're
 

4191
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,820
space we're good at and like what we're
not and I guess what the outright so I

4192
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:21,830
not and I guess what the outright so I
 

4193
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:23,800
not and I guess what the outright so I
mean I would say that we're at an early

4194
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:23,810
mean I would say that we're at an early
 

4195
01:21:23,810 --> 01:21:26,470
mean I would say that we're at an early
stage in knowing how to do that okay so

4196
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:26,480
stage in knowing how to do that okay so
 

4197
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:29,080
stage in knowing how to do that okay so
I've done lots of these things and they

4198
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:29,090
I've done lots of these things and they
 

4199
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:31,990
I've done lots of these things and they
are the thing that I've noticed is if

4200
01:21:31,990 --> 01:21:32,000
are the thing that I've noticed is if
 

4201
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,540
are the thing that I've noticed is if
you do an exhaustive search then you

4202
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:34,550
you do an exhaustive search then you
 

4203
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:36,220
you do an exhaustive search then you
don't miss even things that you weren't

4204
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:36,230
don't miss even things that you weren't
 

4205
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:38,920
don't miss even things that you weren't
looking for if you do a non exhaustive

4206
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:38,930
looking for if you do a non exhaustive
 

4207
01:21:38,930 --> 01:21:41,979
looking for if you do a non exhaustive
search there is a tremendous tendency to

4208
01:21:41,979 --> 01:21:41,989
search there is a tremendous tendency to
 

4209
01:21:41,989 --> 01:21:43,590
search there is a tremendous tendency to
miss things that you weren't looking for

4210
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:43,600
miss things that you weren't looking for
 

4211
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:48,459

and so you know we've done such as a
 

4213

how to do those searches well my guess
is that there'll be some sort of

4321
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,569
universe is is where one's going to see
progress but it's it's a it's a really

4322
01:23:51,569 --> 01:23:51,579
progress but it's it's a it's a really
 

4323
01:23:51,579 --> 01:23:54,810
progress but it's it's a it's a really
interesting area and you know I consider

4324
01:23:54,810 --> 01:23:54,820
interesting area and you know I consider
 

4325
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:56,669
interesting area and you know I consider
us only at the at the beginning of

4326
01:23:56,669 --> 01:23:56,679
us only at the at the beginning of
 

4327
01:23:56,679 --> 01:24:04,169
us only at the at the beginning of
figuring that out thank you for your

4328
01:24:04,169 --> 01:24:04,179
figuring that out thank you for your
 

4329
01:24:04,179 --> 01:24:06,029
figuring that out thank you for your
talk I just to give you a bit of context

4330
01:24:06,029 --> 01:24:06,039
talk I just to give you a bit of context
 

4331
01:24:06,039 --> 01:24:08,310
talk I just to give you a bit of context
for my question I research how we could

4332
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:08,320
for my question I research how we could
 

4333
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,290
for my question I research how we could
teach AI to kids and evolving platforms

4334
01:24:10,290 --> 01:24:10,300
teach AI to kids and evolving platforms
 

4335
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:11,760
teach AI to kids and evolving platforms
for that how we could teach artificial

4336
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:11,770
for that how we could teach artificial
 

4337
01:24:11,770 --> 01:24:12,899
for that how we could teach artificial
intelligence and machine learning to

4338
01:24:12,899 --> 01:24:12,909
intelligence and machine learning to
 

4339
01:24:12,909 --> 01:24:14,490
intelligence and machine learning to
children and I know you develop

4340
01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:14,500
children and I know you develop
 

4341
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:17,700
children and I know you develop
resources for that as well so I was

4342
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:17,710
resources for that as well so I was
 

4343
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:19,950
resources for that as well so I was
wondering like where do you think it's

4344
01:24:19,950 --> 01:24:19,960
wondering like where do you think it's
 

4345
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:21,810
wondering like where do you think it's
problematic that we have computation

4346
01:24:21,810 --> 01:24:21,820
problematic that we have computation
 

4347
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:23,760
problematic that we have computation
that is very efficient and can do you

4348
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:23,770
that is very efficient and can do you
 

4349
01:24:23,770 --> 01:24:25,319
that is very efficient and can do you
know from utilitarian and problem

4350
01:24:25,319 --> 01:24:25,329
know from utilitarian and problem
 

4351
01:24:25,329 --> 01:24:28,020
know from utilitarian and problem
solving perspective it's all the goals

4352
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:28,030
solving perspective it's all the goals
 

4353
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:29,939
solving perspective it's all the goals
but we don't understand how we how it

4354
01:24:29,939 --> 01:24:29,949
but we don't understand how we how it
 

4355
01:24:29,949 --> 01:24:32,250
but we don't understand how we how it
works so we have to create the this fake

4356
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:32,260
works so we have to create the this fake
 

4357
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:34,290
works so we have to create the this fake
steps and if you could think of

4358
01:24:34,290 --> 01:24:34,300
steps and if you could think of
 

4359
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:35,790
steps and if you could think of
scenarios where that could become very

4360
01:24:35,790 --> 01:24:35,800
scenarios where that could become very
 

4361
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,709
scenarios where that could become very
problematic over time and why do we

4362
01:24:37,709 --> 01:24:37,719
problematic over time and why do we
 

4363
01:24:37,719 --> 01:24:40,140
problematic over time and why do we
approach it such in such a deterministic

4364
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:40,150
approach it such in such a deterministic
 

4365
01:24:40,150 --> 01:24:41,729
approach it such in such a deterministic
way and when you mentioned that

4366
01:24:41,729 --> 01:24:41,739
way and when you mentioned that
 

4367
01:24:41,739 --> 01:24:43,560
way and when you mentioned that
computation and intelligence are dafair

4368
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:43,570
computation and intelligence are dafair
 

4369
01:24:43,570 --> 01:24:45,540
computation and intelligence are dafair
differentiated by this like very thin

line how does that affect the way you

4372
01:24:47,609 --> 01:24:47,619
line how does that affect the way you
 

4373
01:24:47,619 --> 01:24:48,899
line how does that affect the way you
learn and how do you think that will

4374
01:24:48,899 --> 01:24:48,909
learn and how do you think that will
 

4375
01:24:48,909 --> 01:24:51,270
learn and how do you think that will
affect the way we kids learn we learn

again um you know it's been up and down
for 40 years or so um okay why doesn't

4432
01:25:55,709 --> 01:25:55,719
for 40 years or so um okay why doesn't
 

4433

engineering style coding and it really
 

4443
01:26:06,219 --> 01:26:08,489
engineering style coding and it really

01:26:14,469 --> 01:26:16,560
going to write a low-level C program or
something and it's the same thing that's

01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:16,570
something and it's the same thing that's
 

4453
01:26:16,570 --> 01:26:18,419
something and it's the same thing that's
happened in math education which has

01:26:18,419 --> 01:26:18,429
happened in math education which has
 

4455
01:26:18,429 --> 01:26:20,520
happened in math education which has
been sort of a disaster there which is

01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:20,530
been sort of a disaster there which is

the number one takeaway for most people
 

4459
01:26:23,289 --> 01:26:25,350
the number one takeaway for most people
from the math they learn in school is I

4460
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:25,360
from the math they learn in school is I
 

4461
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:29,370
from the math they learn in school is I
don't like math and you know that's not

4462
01:26:29,370 --> 01:26:29,380
don't like math and you know that's not
 

4463
01:26:29,380 --> 01:26:31,140
don't like math and you know that's not
for all of them obviously but that's the

4464
01:26:31,140 --> 01:26:31,150
for all of them obviously but that's the
 

4465
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:33,209
for all of them obviously but that's the
you know if you asked no general scale

4466
01:26:33,209 --> 01:26:33,219
you know if you asked no general scale
 

4467
01:26:33,219 --> 01:26:35,520
you know if you asked no general scale
you know what people and why is that

4468
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:35,530
you know what people and why is that
 

4469
01:26:35,530 --> 01:26:36,540
you know what people and why is that
well part of the reason is because

4470
01:26:36,540 --> 01:26:36,550
well part of the reason is because
 

4471
01:26:36,550 --> 01:26:38,520
well part of the reason is because
what's been taught is rather low level

4472

of mechanical it's not about
mathematical thinking particularly it's

4476
01:26:43,169 --> 01:26:43,179
mathematical thinking particularly it's
 

4477
01:26:43,179 --> 01:26:45,120
mathematical thinking particularly it's
mostly about you know what teachers can

4478
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:45,130
mostly about you know what teachers can
 

4479
01:26:45,130 --> 01:26:46,979
mostly about you know what teachers can
teach and what assessment processes can

4480
01:26:46,979 --> 01:26:46,989
teach and what assessment processes can
 

4481
01:26:46,989 --> 01:26:49,500
teach and what assessment processes can
assess and so on okay so how should one

4482
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:49,510
assess and so on okay so how should one
 

4483
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:51,479
assess and so on okay so how should one
teach computational thinking I mean I'm

4484
01:26:51,479 --> 01:26:51,489
teach computational thinking I mean I'm
 

4485
01:26:51,489 --> 01:26:53,609
teach computational thinking I mean I'm
I'm kind of excited about what we can do

4486
01:26:53,609 --> 01:26:53,619
I'm kind of excited about what we can do
 

4487
01:26:53,619 --> 01:26:55,410
I'm kind of excited about what we can do
with whorfin language because I think we

4488
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:55,420
with whorfin language because I think we
 

4489
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:57,540
with whorfin language because I think we
have a high enough level language that

4490
01:26:57,540 --> 01:26:57,550
have a high enough level language that
 

4491
01:26:57,550 --> 01:27:00,719
have a high enough level language that
people can actually write you know that

4492
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:00,729
people can actually write you know that
 

4493
01:27:00,729 --> 01:27:03,810
people can actually write you know that
for example I I reckon by age 11 or 12

4494
01:27:03,810 --> 01:27:03,820
for example I I reckon by age 11 or 12
 

4495
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:06,089
for example I I reckon by age 11 or 12
and I've done many experiments on this I

4496
01:27:06,089 --> 01:27:06,099
and I've done many experiments on this I
 

4497
01:27:06,099 --> 01:27:08,160
and I've done many experiments on this I
have some the only problem with my

4498
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:08,170
have some the only problem with my
 

4499
01:27:08,170 --> 01:27:09,719
have some the only problem with my
experiments is most of my experiments

4500
01:27:09,719 --> 01:27:09,729
experiments is most of my experiments
 

4501
01:27:09,729 --> 01:27:11,489
experiments is most of my experiments
end up being with kids who are high

4502
01:27:11,489 --> 01:27:11,499
end up being with kids who are high
 

4503
01:27:11,499 --> 01:27:14,279
end up being with kids who are high
achieving kids despite many efforts to

4504
01:27:14,279 --> 01:27:14,289
achieving kids despite many efforts to
 

4505
01:27:14,289 --> 01:27:15,870
achieving kids despite many efforts to
reach lower achieving kids that always

4506
01:27:15,870 --> 01:27:15,880
reach lower achieving kids that always
 

4507
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:18,149
reach lower achieving kids that always
ends up that the kids who actually do

4508
01:27:18,149 --> 01:27:18,159
ends up that the kids who actually do
 

4509
01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:19,979
ends up that the kids who actually do
the things that I set up or the high

4510
01:27:19,979 --> 01:27:19,989
the things that I set up or the high
 

4511
01:27:19,989 --> 01:27:21,810
the things that I set up or the high
achieving kids but but you know like

4512
01:27:21,810 --> 01:27:21,820
achieving kids but but you know like
 

4513
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:22,770
achieving kids but but you know like
setting that aside

4514
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:22,780
setting that aside
 

4515
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:27,239
setting that aside
you know you take the typical you know

4516
01:27:27,239 --> 01:27:27,249
you know you take the typical you know
 

4517
01:27:27,249 --> 01:27:30,149
you know you take the typical you know
11 12 13 year-olds and so on and they

4518
01:27:30,149 --> 01:27:30,159
11 12 13 year-olds and so on and they
 

4519
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:32,489
11 12 13 year-olds and so on and they
can learn how to write stuff in this

4520
01:27:32,489 --> 01:27:32,499
can learn how to write stuff in this
 

4521
01:27:32,499 --> 01:27:35,129
can learn how to write stuff in this
language and what's interesting is they

4522
01:27:35,129 --> 01:27:35,139
language and what's interesting is they
 

4523
01:27:35,139 --> 01:27:36,600
language and what's interesting is they
learn to start thinking here I'll show

4524
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:36,610
learn to start thinking here I'll show
 

4525
01:27:36,610 --> 01:27:38,160
learn to start thinking here I'll show
you let's be very practical I can show

4526
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:38,170
you let's be very practical I can show
 

4527
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:40,049
you let's be very practical I can show
you I was doing every Sunday I do a

4528
01:27:40,049 --> 01:27:40,059
you I was doing every Sunday I do a
 

4529
01:27:40,059 --> 01:27:41,669
you I was doing every Sunday I do a
little little thing with some middle

4530
01:27:41,669 --> 01:27:41,679
little little thing with some middle
 

4531
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:41,910
little little thing with some middle
school

4532
01:27:41,910 --> 01:27:41,920
school
 

4533
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,400
school
kids and I might even be able to find my

4534
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:44,410
kids and I might even be able to find my
 

4535
01:27:44,410 --> 01:27:46,680
kids and I might even be able to find my
stuff from yesterday this is this is um

4536
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:46,690
stuff from yesterday this is this is um
 

4537
01:27:46,690 --> 01:27:48,170
stuff from yesterday this is this is um
okay let's see

4538
01:27:48,170 --> 01:27:48,180
okay let's see
 

4539
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:52,380
okay let's see
programming adventures Janerio 28 okay

4540
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:52,390
programming adventures Janerio 28 okay
 

4541
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:53,370
programming adventures Janerio 28 okay
let's see what I did

4542
01:27:53,370 --> 01:27:53,380
let's see what I did
 

4543
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:55,230
let's see what I did
oh look at that that was that was why I

4544
01:27:55,230 --> 01:27:55,240
oh look at that that was that was why I
 

4545
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:56,820
oh look at that that was that was why I
thought of the South America thing here

4546
01:27:56,820 --> 01:27:56,830
thought of the South America thing here
 

4547
01:27:56,830 --> 01:27:58,850
thought of the South America thing here
because I just done that with these kids

4548
01:27:58,850 --> 01:27:58,860
because I just done that with these kids
 

4549
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:03,960
because I just done that with these kids
the and so what are we doing we were

4550
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:03,970
the and so what are we doing we were
 

4551
01:28:03,970 --> 01:28:08,510
the and so what are we doing we were
trying to figure out this this some

4552
01:28:08,510 --> 01:28:08,520
trying to figure out this this some
 

4553
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:10,590
trying to figure out this this some
trying to figure out the shortest tour

4554
01:28:10,590 --> 01:28:10,600
trying to figure out the shortest tour
 

4555
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:12,300
trying to figure out the shortest tour
thing like that I just showed you which

4556
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:12,310
thing like that I just showed you which
 

4557
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:15,450
thing like that I just showed you which
is this is where I got what you is is

4558
01:28:15,450 --> 01:28:15,460
is this is where I got what you is is
 

4559
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:16,860
is this is where I got what you is is
what I was doing with these kids but

4560
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:16,870
what I was doing with these kids but
 

4561
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:19,320
what I was doing with these kids but
this this was my version of this but the

4562
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:19,330
this this was my version of this but the
 

4563
01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:21,000
this this was my version of this but the
kids all had various different versions

4564
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:21,010
kids all had various different versions
 

4565
01:28:21,010 --> 01:28:24,240
kids all had various different versions
of this and we had somebody suggested

4566
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:24,250
of this and we had somebody suggested
 

4567
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:27,480
of this and we had somebody suggested
you know let's just enumerate let's just

4568
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:27,490
you know let's just enumerate let's just
 

4569
01:28:27,490 --> 01:28:29,670
you know let's just enumerate let's just
look at all possible permutations of

4570
01:28:29,670 --> 01:28:29,680
look at all possible permutations of
 

4571
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:32,490
look at all possible permutations of
these these cities and figure out what

4572
01:28:32,490 --> 01:28:32,500
these these cities and figure out what
 

4573
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:33,810
these these cities and figure out what
their distances are there's the

4574
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:33,820
their distances are there's the
 

4575
01:28:33,820 --> 01:28:36,000
their distances are there's the
histogram of those that's what we get

4576
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:36,010
histogram of those that's what we get
 

4577
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:38,310
histogram of those that's what we get
from those okay how do you get the

4578
01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:38,320
from those okay how do you get the
 

4579
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:39,990
from those okay how do you get the
largest distance from those etcetera

4580
01:28:39,990 --> 01:28:40,000
largest distance from those etcetera
 

4581
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,180
largest distance from those etcetera
etcetera and this is okay this was my

4582
01:28:42,180 --> 01:28:42,190
etcetera and this is okay this was my
 

4583
01:28:42,190 --> 01:28:44,010
etcetera and this is okay this was my
version of it but the kids had similar

4584
01:28:44,010 --> 01:28:44,020
version of it but the kids had similar
 

4585
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:47,130
version of it but the kids had similar
stuff and this is you know this is I

4586
01:28:47,130 --> 01:28:47,140
stuff and this is you know this is I
 

4587
01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:49,560
stuff and this is you know this is I
think and it probably went off into oh

4588
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:49,570
think and it probably went off into oh
 

4589
01:28:49,570 --> 01:28:51,150
think and it probably went off into oh
yeah there we go there's there's the one

4590
01:28:51,150 --> 01:28:51,160
yeah there we go there's there's the one
 

4591
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:53,190
yeah there we go there's there's the one
for the whole whole earth and then they

4592
01:28:53,190 --> 01:28:53,200
for the whole whole earth and then they
 

4593
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:55,620
for the whole whole earth and then they
wanted to know how do you do that in 3d

4594
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:55,630
wanted to know how do you do that in 3d
 

4595
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:58,680
wanted to know how do you do that in 3d
so I was showing them how to convert to

4596
01:28:58,680 --> 01:28:58,690
so I was showing them how to convert to
 

4597
01:28:58,690 --> 01:29:01,680
so I was showing them how to convert to
XYZ coordinates in 3d and make the

4598
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:01,690
XYZ coordinates in 3d and make the
 

4599
01:29:01,690 --> 01:29:05,550
XYZ coordinates in 3d and make the
corresponding thing in 3d so what's this

4600
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:05,560
corresponding thing in 3d so what's this
 

4601
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:07,830
corresponding thing in 3d so what's this
maybe isn't the this is a random example

4602
01:29:07,830 --> 01:29:07,840
maybe isn't the this is a random example
 

4603
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,260
maybe isn't the this is a random example
from yesterday so it's not not a highly

4604
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:10,270
from yesterday so it's not not a highly
 

4605
01:29:10,270 --> 01:29:13,440
from yesterday so it's not not a highly
considered example but but um what I

4606
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:13,450
considered example but but um what I
 

4607
01:29:13,450 --> 01:29:16,230
considered example but but um what I
think is interesting is that we seem to

4608
01:29:16,230 --> 01:29:16,240
think is interesting is that we seem to
 

4609
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:17,610
think is interesting is that we seem to
have finally reached the point where

4610
01:29:17,610 --> 01:29:17,620
have finally reached the point where
 

4611
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:20,160
have finally reached the point where
we've automated enough of the actual

4612
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:20,170
we've automated enough of the actual
 

4613
01:29:20,170 --> 01:29:22,980
we've automated enough of the actual
doing of the computation that the kids

4614
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:22,990
doing of the computation that the kids
 

4615
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:25,860
doing of the computation that the kids
can be exposed mostly to thinking about

4616
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:25,870
can be exposed mostly to thinking about
 

4617
01:29:25,870 --> 01:29:28,380
can be exposed mostly to thinking about
what you might want to compute and you

4618
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:28,390
what you might want to compute and you
 

4619
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:30,780
what you might want to compute and you
know part of our role in language design

4620
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:30,790
know part of our role in language design
 

4621
01:29:30,790 --> 01:29:32,910
know part of our role in language design
as far as I'm concerned is to get it as

4622
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:32,920
as far as I'm concerned is to get it as
 

4623
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:35,040
as far as I'm concerned is to get it as
much as possible to the point where for

4624
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:35,050
much as possible to the point where for
 

4625
01:29:35,050 --> 01:29:36,210
much as possible to the point where for
example you can do a bunch of natural

4626
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:36,220
example you can do a bunch of natural
 

4627
01:29:36,220 --> 01:29:38,490
example you can do a bunch of natural
language input you can do things which

4628
01:29:38,490 --> 01:29:38,500
language input you can do things which
 

4629
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:41,700
language input you can do things which
make it as easy as possible for kids to

4630
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:41,710
make it as easy as possible for kids to
 

4631
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:43,800
make it as easy as possible for kids to
not get mixed up in the kind of what the

4632
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:43,810
not get mixed up in the kind of what the
 

4633
01:29:43,810 --> 01:29:45,840
not get mixed up in the kind of what the
you know how the computation gets done

4634
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:45,850
you know how the computation gets done
 

4635
01:29:45,850 --> 01:29:47,220
you know how the computation gets done
but rather to just think about how you

4636
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:47,230
but rather to just think about how you
 

4637
01:29:47,230 --> 01:29:49,020
but rather to just think about how you
formulate the computation so for example

4638
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:49,030
formulate the computation so for example
 

4639
01:29:49,030 --> 01:29:50,700
formulate the computation so for example
a typical example I've used much times

4640
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:50,710
a typical example I've used much times
 

4641
01:29:50,710 --> 01:29:53,460
a typical example I've used much times
in you know what does it mean to do

4642
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:53,470
in you know what does it mean to do
 

4643
01:29:53,470 --> 01:29:55,240
in you know what does it mean to do
write code versus two other

4644
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:55,250
write code versus two other
 

4645
01:29:55,250 --> 01:29:56,980
write code versus two other
things like a typical set of test

01:29:56,980 --> 01:29:56,990
things like a typical set of test
 

4647
01:29:56,990 --> 01:29:59,350
things like a typical set of test
example would be I don't know you ask

4648
01:29:59,350 --> 01:29:59,360
example would be I don't know you ask
 

4649
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,660
example would be I don't know you ask
somebody you're gonna there's practical

01:30:05,290 --> 01:30:05,300
a lat long position on the earth and you
 

4655
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:07,420
a lat long position on the earth and you
say you're gonna make a map of that like

4656
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:07,430
say you're gonna make a map of that like
 

4657
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:09,940
say you're gonna make a map of that like
long position what what scale of map

4658
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:09,950
long position what what scale of map
 

4659
01:30:09,950 --> 01:30:11,680

Manhattan a 10-mile radius map might be
 

4671
01:30:20,210 --> 01:30:22,270
Manhattan a 10-mile radius map might be
quite quite a sensible thing to do so

4672
01:30:22,270 --> 01:30:22,280
quite quite a sensible thing to do so
 

4673
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:23,320
quite quite a sensible thing to do so
the question is come up with an

4674
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:23,330
the question is come up with an
 

4675
01:30:23,330 --> 01:30:24,730
the question is come up with an
algorithm come up with even a way of

4676
01:30:24,730 --> 01:30:24,740
algorithm come up with even a way of
 

4677
01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:26,740
algorithm come up with even a way of
thinking about that question what do you

4678
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:26,750
thinking about that question what do you
 

4679
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:28,540
thinking about that question what do you
do you know how should you figure that

4680
01:30:28,540 --> 01:30:28,550
do you know how should you figure that
 

4681
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:31,180
do you know how should you figure that
out well you might say you know oh let's

4682
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:31,190
out well you might say you know oh let's
 

4683
01:30:31,190 --> 01:30:33,040
out well you might say you know oh let's
look at the visual complexity of the

4684
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:33,050
look at the visual complexity of the
 

4685
01:30:33,050 --> 01:30:35,710
look at the visual complexity of the
image let's look at how far it is to

4686
01:30:35,710 --> 01:30:35,720
image let's look at how far it is to
 

4687
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:38,020
image let's look at how far it is to
another city let's fight you know there

4688
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:38,030
another city let's fight you know there
 

4689
01:30:38,030 --> 01:30:39,910
another city let's fight you know there
various different things but thinking

4690
01:30:39,910 --> 01:30:39,920
various different things but thinking
 

4691
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:41,440
various different things but thinking
about that as a kind of computational

4692
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:41,450
about that as a kind of computational
 

4693
01:30:41,450 --> 01:30:47,290
about that as a kind of computational
thinking exercise that term is you know

4694
01:30:47,290 --> 01:30:47,300
thinking exercise that term is you know
 

4695
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:49,150
thinking exercise that term is you know
that's the kind of thing so in terms of

4696
01:30:49,150 --> 01:30:49,160
that's the kind of thing so in terms of
 

4697
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:51,160
that's the kind of thing so in terms of
what one automates and whether people

4698
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:51,170
what one automates and whether people
 

4699
01:30:51,170 --> 01:30:52,660
what one automates and whether people
whether people need to understand how it

4700
01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:52,670
whether people need to understand how it
 

4701
01:30:52,670 --> 01:30:58,980
whether people need to understand how it
works inside okay main point is you'll

4702
01:30:58,980 --> 01:30:58,990
works inside okay main point is you'll
 

4703
01:30:58,990 --> 01:31:01,750
works inside okay main point is you'll
in the end it will not be possible to

4704
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:01,760
in the end it will not be possible to
 

4705
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:04,090
in the end it will not be possible to
know how it works inside so you might as

4706
01:31:04,090 --> 01:31:04,100
know how it works inside so you might as
 

4707
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:06,220
know how it works inside so you might as
well stop having that be a criterion I

4708
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:06,230
well stop having that be a criterion I
 

4709
01:31:06,230 --> 01:31:07,960
well stop having that be a criterion I
mean that is there plenty of things that

4710
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:07,970
mean that is there plenty of things that
 

4711
01:31:07,970 --> 01:31:11,850
mean that is there plenty of things that
one teaches people that let's say in

4712
01:31:11,850 --> 01:31:11,860
one teaches people that let's say in
 

4713
01:31:11,860 --> 01:31:14,140
one teaches people that let's say in
lots of areas of biology medicine

4714
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:14,150
lots of areas of biology medicine
 

4715
01:31:14,150 --> 01:31:16,840
lots of areas of biology medicine
whatever else you know maybe we'll know

4716
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:16,850
whatever else you know maybe we'll know
 

4717
01:31:16,850 --> 01:31:18,850
whatever else you know maybe we'll know
how it works inside one day but you can

4718
01:31:18,850 --> 01:31:18,860
how it works inside one day but you can
 

4719
01:31:18,860 --> 01:31:20,200
how it works inside one day but you can
still there's an awful lot of useful

4720
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:20,210
still there's an awful lot of useful
 

4721
01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:21,880
still there's an awful lot of useful
stuff you can teach without knowing how

4722
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:21,890
stuff you can teach without knowing how
 

4723
01:31:21,890 --> 01:31:24,670
stuff you can teach without knowing how
it works inside and I think also as we

4724
01:31:24,670 --> 01:31:24,680
it works inside and I think also as we
 

4725
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:26,320
it works inside and I think also as we
get computation to be more efficient

4726
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:26,330
get computation to be more efficient
 

4727
01:31:26,330 --> 01:31:27,790
get computation to be more efficient
inevitably we will be dealing with

4728
01:31:27,790 --> 01:31:27,800
inevitably we will be dealing with
 

4729
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:28,840
inevitably we will be dealing with
things where you don't know how it works

4730
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:28,850
things where you don't know how it works
 

4731
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:30,700
things where you don't know how it works
inside now you know we've seen this in

4732
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:30,710
inside now you know we've seen this in
 

4733
01:31:30,710 --> 01:31:32,170
inside now you know we've seen this in
math education because I've happened to

4734
01:31:32,170 --> 01:31:32,180
math education because I've happened to
 

4735
01:31:32,180 --> 01:31:34,570
math education because I've happened to
made tools that automate a bunch of

4736
01:31:34,570 --> 01:31:34,580
made tools that automate a bunch of
 

4737
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:36,070
made tools that automate a bunch of
things that people do in math education

4738
01:31:36,070 --> 01:31:36,080
things that people do in math education
 

4739
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:40,300
things that people do in math education
and I think well to tell a silly story

4740
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:40,310
and I think well to tell a silly story
 

4741
01:31:40,310 --> 01:31:43,210
and I think well to tell a silly story
I'm in my my older daughter who at some

4742
01:31:43,210 --> 01:31:43,220
I'm in my my older daughter who at some
 

4743
01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:44,560
I'm in my my older daughter who at some
point in the past was doing you know

4744
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:44,570
point in the past was doing you know
 

4745
01:31:44,570 --> 01:31:46,540
point in the past was doing you know
calculus you know and learning doing

4746
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:46,550
calculus you know and learning doing
 

4747
01:31:46,550 --> 01:31:48,460
calculus you know and learning doing
integrals and things and I was saying to

4748
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:48,470
integrals and things and I was saying to
 

4749
01:31:48,470 --> 01:31:50,320
integrals and things and I was saying to
her you know I didn't think humans still

4750
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:50,330
her you know I didn't think humans still
 

4751
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:54,240
her you know I didn't think humans still
did that stuff anymore which was a very

4752
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:54,250
did that stuff anymore which was a very
 

4753
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:58,240
did that stuff anymore which was a very
unintelligent fit but in any case I mean

4754
01:31:58,240 --> 01:31:58,250
unintelligent fit but in any case I mean
 

4755
01:31:58,250 --> 01:31:59,860
unintelligent fit but in any case I mean
the the you know there's a question of

4756
01:31:59,860 --> 01:31:59,870
the the you know there's a question of
 

4757
01:31:59,870 --> 01:32:02,140
the the you know there's a question of
whether do humans need to know how to do

4758
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:02,150
whether do humans need to know how to do
 

4759
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:04,720
whether do humans need to know how to do
that stuff or not so I haven't done an

4760
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:04,730
that stuff or not so I haven't done an
 

4761
01:32:04,730 --> 01:32:06,340
that stuff or not so I haven't done an
integral by hand and probably thirty

4762
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:06,350
integral by hand and probably thirty
 

4763
01:32:06,350 --> 01:32:07,300
integral by hand and probably thirty
five years

4764
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:07,310
five years
 

4765
01:32:07,310 --> 01:32:11,500
five years
a true more or less true then but when I

4766
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:11,510
a true more or less true then but when I
 

4767
01:32:11,510 --> 01:32:15,220
a true more or less true then but when I
was using computers to do them the I was

4768
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:15,230
was using computers to do them the I was
 

4769
01:32:15,230 --> 01:32:16,900
was using computers to do them the I was
for a while you know I used to do

4770
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:16,910
for a while you know I used to do
 

4771
01:32:16,910 --> 01:32:18,520
for a while you know I used to do
physics and so I used computers to do

4772
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:18,530
physics and so I used computers to do
 

4773
01:32:18,530 --> 01:32:20,770
physics and so I used computers to do
this stuff I was a really really good

4774
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:20,780
this stuff I was a really really good
 

4775
01:32:20,780 --> 01:32:23,890
this stuff I was a really really good
integrator except that it wasn't really

4776
01:32:23,890 --> 01:32:23,900
integrator except that it wasn't really
 

4777
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:26,200
integrator except that it wasn't really
me it was me plus the computer so how

4778
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:26,210
me it was me plus the computer so how
 

4779
01:32:26,210 --> 01:32:27,010
me it was me plus the computer so how
did that come to be

4780
01:32:27,010 --> 01:32:27,020
did that come to be
 

4781
01:32:27,020 --> 01:32:29,140
did that come to be
well the answer was that because I was

4782
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:29,150
well the answer was that because I was
 

4783
01:32:29,150 --> 01:32:31,000
well the answer was that because I was
doing things by computer I was able to

4784
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:31,010
doing things by computer I was able to
 

4785
01:32:31,010 --> 01:32:33,460
doing things by computer I was able to
try zillions of examples and I got a

4786
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:33,470
try zillions of examples and I got a
 

4787
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:35,380
try zillions of examples and I got a
much better intuition the most people

4788
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:35,390
much better intuition the most people
 

4789
01:32:35,390 --> 01:32:36,820
much better intuition the most people
got for how these things would work

4790
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:36,830
got for how these things would work
 

4791
01:32:36,830 --> 01:32:39,640
got for how these things would work
roughly how what you did to make the

4792
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:39,650
roughly how what you did to make the
 

4793
01:32:39,650 --> 01:32:41,800
roughly how what you did to make the
thing go and so on whereas people who

4794
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:41,810
thing go and so on whereas people who
 

4795
01:32:41,810 --> 01:32:43,480
thing go and so on whereas people who
are like I'm just working this one thing

4796
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:43,490
are like I'm just working this one thing
 

4797
01:32:43,490 --> 01:32:44,290
are like I'm just working this one thing
out by hand

4798
01:32:44,290 --> 01:32:44,300
out by hand
 

4799
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:46,360
out by hand
you got a different you know you don't

4800
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:46,370
you got a different you know you don't
 

4801
01:32:46,370 --> 01:32:48,070
you got a different you know you don't
get that intuition so I think you know

4802
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:48,080
get that intuition so I think you know
 

4803
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:50,620
get that intuition so I think you know
two points first of all you know this

4804
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:50,630
two points first of all you know this
 

4805
01:32:50,630 --> 01:32:52,180
two points first of all you know this
how do you think about things

4806
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:52,190
how do you think about things
 

4807
01:32:52,190 --> 01:32:54,010
how do you think about things
computationally how do you formulate the

4808
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:54,020
computationally how do you formulate the
 

4809
01:32:54,020 --> 01:32:56,020
computationally how do you formulate the
question computationally that's really

4810
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:56,030
question computationally that's really
 

4811
01:32:56,030 --> 01:32:57,550
question computationally that's really
important and something that we are now

4812
01:32:57,550 --> 01:32:57,560
important and something that we are now
 

4813
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:59,290
important and something that we are now
in a position I think to actually teach

4814
01:32:59,290 --> 01:32:59,300
in a position I think to actually teach
 

4815
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:01,510
in a position I think to actually teach
and it is not really something you teach

4816
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:01,520
and it is not really something you teach
 

4817
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:04,000
and it is not really something you teach
by you know teaching you know

4818
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:04,010
by you know teaching you know
 

4819
01:33:04,010 --> 01:33:06,640
by you know teaching you know
traditional quotes coding because a lot

4820
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:06,650
traditional quotes coding because a lot
 

4821
01:33:06,650 --> 01:33:08,260
traditional quotes coding because a lot
of that is okay we're gonna make a loop

4822
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:08,270
of that is okay we're gonna make a loop
 

4823
01:33:08,270 --> 01:33:10,600
of that is okay we're gonna make a loop
we're going to define variables I just

4824
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:10,610
we're going to define variables I just
 

4825
01:33:10,610 --> 01:33:12,040
we're going to define variables I just
as I think I probably have a copy here

4826
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:12,050
as I think I probably have a copy here
 

4827
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:15,010
as I think I probably have a copy here
yeah they I wrote this book for this is

4828
01:33:15,010 --> 01:33:15,020
yeah they I wrote this book for this is
 

4829
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:16,720
yeah they I wrote this book for this is
a book kind of for kids about often

4830
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:16,730
a book kind of for kids about often
 

4831
01:33:16,730 --> 01:33:18,760
a book kind of for kids about often
language except it seems to be useful to

4832
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:18,770
language except it seems to be useful to
 

4833
01:33:18,770 --> 01:33:20,800
language except it seems to be useful to
adults as well but I wrote it for kids

4834
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:20,810
adults as well but I wrote it for kids
 

4835
01:33:20,810 --> 01:33:23,740
adults as well but I wrote it for kids
so it's some and one of the amusing

4836
01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:23,750
so it's some and one of the amusing
 

4837
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:25,480
so it's some and one of the amusing
things in this book is it doesn't

4838
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:25,490
things in this book is it doesn't
 

4839
01:33:25,490 --> 01:33:27,460
things in this book is it doesn't
talking it talked about assigning values

4840
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:27,470
talking it talked about assigning values
 

4841
01:33:27,470 --> 01:33:31,510
talking it talked about assigning values
to variables until chapter 38 so in

4842
01:33:31,510 --> 01:33:31,520
to variables until chapter 38 so in
 

4843
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,650
to variables until chapter 38 so in
other words that will be a thing that

4844
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:32,660
other words that will be a thing that
 

4845
01:33:32,660 --> 01:33:34,570
other words that will be a thing that
you would find in Chapter one of most

4846
01:33:34,570 --> 01:33:34,580
you would find in Chapter one of most
 

4847
01:33:34,580 --> 01:33:37,390
you would find in Chapter one of most
you know low-level programming coding

4848
01:33:37,390 --> 01:33:37,400
you know low-level programming coding
 

4849
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:39,190
you know low-level programming coding
type type things turns out it's not that

4850
01:33:39,190 --> 01:33:39,200
type type things turns out it's not that
 

4851
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:41,200
type type things turns out it's not that
relevant to know how to do that it's

4852
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:41,210
relevant to know how to do that it's
 

4853
01:33:41,210 --> 01:33:45,250
relevant to know how to do that it's
also kind of confusing and not necessary

4854
01:33:45,250 --> 01:33:45,260
also kind of confusing and not necessary
 

4855
01:33:45,260 --> 01:33:48,340
also kind of confusing and not necessary
and so you know in terms of the you

4856
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:48,350
and so you know in terms of the you
 

4857
01:33:48,350 --> 01:33:49,600
and so you know in terms of the you
asked where will we get in trouble when

4858
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:49,610
asked where will we get in trouble when
 

4859
01:33:49,610 --> 01:33:50,800
asked where will we get in trouble when
people don't know how the stuff works

4860
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:50,810
people don't know how the stuff works
 

4861
01:33:50,810 --> 01:33:55,480
people don't know how the stuff works
inside that's I mean you know I think

4862
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:55,490
inside that's I mean you know I think
 

4863
01:33:55,490 --> 01:33:57,130
inside that's I mean you know I think
one just has to get used to that because

4864
01:33:57,130 --> 01:33:57,140
one just has to get used to that because
 

4865
01:33:57,140 --> 01:33:59,500
one just has to get used to that because
it's like you know you might say well we

4866
01:33:59,500 --> 01:33:59,510
it's like you know you might say well we
 

4867
01:33:59,510 --> 01:34:01,000
it's like you know you might say well we
live in the world and it's full of

4868
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:01,010
live in the world and it's full of
 

4869
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:02,740
live in the world and it's full of
natural processes where we don't know

4870
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:02,750
natural processes where we don't know
 

4871
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:04,600
natural processes where we don't know
how they work inside but somehow we

4872
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:04,610
how they work inside but somehow we
 

4873
01:34:04,610 --> 01:34:07,450
how they work inside but somehow we
manage to survive and we go to a lot of

4874
01:34:07,450 --> 01:34:07,460
manage to survive and we go to a lot of
 

4875
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:09,250
manage to survive and we go to a lot of
effort to do natural science to try and

4876
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:09,260
effort to do natural science to try and
 

4877
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:11,770
effort to do natural science to try and
figure out how stuff works inside but it

4878
01:34:11,770 --> 01:34:11,780
figure out how stuff works inside but it
 

4879
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:13,450
figure out how stuff works inside but it
turns out we can still use plenty of

4880
01:34:13,450 --> 01:34:13,460
turns out we can still use plenty of
 

4881
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:14,680
turns out we can still use plenty of
things even when we don't know how they

4882
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:14,690
things even when we don't know how they
 

4883
01:34:14,690 --> 01:34:17,319
things even when we don't know how they
work inside we don't need to know

4884
01:34:17,319 --> 01:34:17,329
work inside we don't need to know
 

4885
01:34:17,329 --> 01:34:19,899
work inside we don't need to know
and I think the May I think the main

01:34:19,899 --> 01:34:19,909
and I think the May I think the main
 

4887

01:35:17,210 --> 01:35:19,149
describing the world that doesn't happen
to relate at all to our historical way

4936
01:35:19,149 --> 01:35:19,159
to relate at all to our historical way
 

4937
01:35:19,159 --> 01:35:21,970
to relate at all to our historical way
of doing it and that's you know it's a

4938
01:35:21,970 --> 01:35:21,980
of doing it and that's you know it's a
 

4939
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:23,919
of doing it and that's you know it's a
little bit disquieting to me as a human

4940
01:35:23,919 --> 01:35:23,929
little bit disquieting to me as a human
 

4941
01:35:23,929 --> 01:35:25,060
little bit disquieting to me as a human
that that you know there are things

4942
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:25,070
that that you know there are things
 

4943
01:35:25,070 --> 01:35:27,040
that that you know there are things
going on inside where I know it is you

4944
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:27,050
going on inside where I know it is you
 

4945
01:35:27,050 --> 01:35:28,689
going on inside where I know it is you
know in principle I could learn that

4946
01:35:28,689 --> 01:35:28,699
know in principle I could learn that
 

4947
01:35:28,699 --> 01:35:32,680
know in principle I could learn that
language but it's you know not the

4948
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:32,690
language but it's you know not the
 

4949
01:35:32,690 --> 01:35:34,359
language but it's you know not the
historical one that we've all learnt and

4950
01:35:34,359 --> 01:35:34,369
historical one that we've all learnt and
 

4951
01:35:34,369 --> 01:35:36,010
historical one that we've all learnt and
it really wouldn't make a lot of sense

4952
01:35:36,010 --> 01:35:36,020
it really wouldn't make a lot of sense
 

4953
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:37,359
it really wouldn't make a lot of sense
to do that because you learn it for one

4954
01:35:37,359 --> 01:35:37,369
to do that because you learn it for one
 

4955
01:35:37,369 --> 01:35:39,399
to do that because you learn it for one
AI and then another one gets trained and

4956
01:35:39,399 --> 01:35:39,409
AI and then another one gets trained and
 

4957
01:35:39,409 --> 01:35:41,560
AI and then another one gets trained and
it's going to use something different so

4958
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:41,570
it's going to use something different so
 

4959
01:35:41,570 --> 01:35:44,049
it's going to use something different so
it's some but my main I guess my main

4960
01:35:44,049 --> 01:35:44,059
it's some but my main I guess my main
 

4961
01:35:44,059 --> 01:35:46,600
it's some but my main I guess my main
point for for education another point

4962
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:46,610
point for for education another point
 

4963
01:35:46,610 --> 01:35:47,919
point for for education another point
about education I just make which is

4964
01:35:47,919 --> 01:35:47,929
about education I just make which is
 

4965
01:35:47,929 --> 01:35:49,270
about education I just make which is
something I haven't figured out but but

4966
01:35:49,270 --> 01:35:49,280
something I haven't figured out but but
 

4967
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:53,620
something I haven't figured out but but
um just is you know when do we get to

4968
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:53,630
um just is you know when do we get to
 

4969
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:55,330
um just is you know when do we get to
make a good model for the human learner

4970
01:35:55,330 --> 01:35:55,340
make a good model for the human learner
 

4971
01:35:55,340 --> 01:35:58,540
make a good model for the human learner
using machine learning so in other words

4972
01:35:58,540 --> 01:35:58,550
using machine learning so in other words
 

4973
01:35:58,550 --> 01:36:00,459
using machine learning so in other words
you know part of what we're trying to do

4974
01:36:00,459 --> 01:36:00,469
you know part of what we're trying to do
 

4975
01:36:00,469 --> 01:36:02,379
you know part of what we're trying to do
like like I've got that automated proof

4976
01:36:02,379 --> 01:36:02,389
like like I've got that automated proof
 

4977
01:36:02,389 --> 01:36:04,839
like like I've got that automated proof
I would really like to manage to figure

4978
01:36:04,839 --> 01:36:04,849
I would really like to manage to figure
 

4979
01:36:04,849 --> 01:36:06,879
I would really like to manage to figure
out a way what is the best way to

4980
01:36:06,879 --> 01:36:06,889
out a way what is the best way to
 

4981
01:36:06,889 --> 01:36:08,589
out a way what is the best way to
present that proof so a human can

4982
01:36:08,589 --> 01:36:08,599
present that proof so a human can
 

4983
01:36:08,599 --> 01:36:11,919
present that proof so a human can
understand it and basically for that we

4984
01:36:11,919 --> 01:36:11,929
understand it and basically for that we
 

4985
01:36:11,929 --> 01:36:13,660
understand it and basically for that we
have to have a bunch of heuristics about

4986
01:36:13,660 --> 01:36:13,670
have to have a bunch of heuristics about
 

4987
01:36:13,670 --> 01:36:15,580
have to have a bunch of heuristics about
how humans understand things so as an

4988
01:36:15,580 --> 01:36:15,590
how humans understand things so as an
 

4989
01:36:15,590 --> 01:36:17,770
how humans understand things so as an
example if we're doing let's say a lot

4990
01:36:17,770 --> 01:36:17,780
example if we're doing let's say a lot
 

4991
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:19,089
example if we're doing let's say a lot
of visualization stuff in welcomed

4992
01:36:19,089 --> 01:36:19,099
of visualization stuff in welcomed
 

4993
01:36:19,099 --> 01:36:21,580
of visualization stuff in welcomed
language okay we have tried to automate

4994
01:36:21,580 --> 01:36:21,590
language okay we have tried to automate
 

4995
01:36:21,590 --> 01:36:24,760
language okay we have tried to automate
do automated aesthetics so what we're

4996
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:24,770
do automated aesthetics so what we're
 

4997
01:36:24,770 --> 01:36:26,350
do automated aesthetics so what we're
doing is you know we're laying out a

4998
01:36:26,350 --> 01:36:26,360
doing is you know we're laying out a
 

4999
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:29,109
doing is you know we're laying out a
graph what way of laying out that graph

5000
01:36:29,109 --> 01:36:29,119
graph what way of laying out that graph
 

5001
01:36:29,119 --> 01:36:31,250
graph what way of laying out that graph
is most likely for humans to understand

5002
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:31,260
is most likely for humans to understand
 

5003
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:33,049
is most likely for humans to understand
and we've done that you know by building

5004
01:36:33,049 --> 01:36:33,059
and we've done that you know by building
 

5005
01:36:33,059 --> 01:36:34,850
and we've done that you know by building
a bunch of heuristics and so on but

5006
01:36:34,850 --> 01:36:34,860
a bunch of heuristics and so on but
 

5007
01:36:34,860 --> 01:36:36,709
a bunch of heuristics and so on but
that's an example of you know if we

5008
01:36:36,709 --> 01:36:36,719
that's an example of you know if we
 

5009
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:38,930
that's an example of you know if we
could do that for learning and we say

5010
01:36:38,930 --> 01:36:38,940
could do that for learning and we say
 

5011
01:36:38,940 --> 01:36:40,609
could do that for learning and we say
what's the optimal path given that the

5012
01:36:40,609 --> 01:36:40,619
what's the optimal path given that the
 

5013
01:36:40,619 --> 01:36:41,930
what's the optimal path given that the
person is trying to understand this

5014
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:41,940
person is trying to understand this
 

5015
01:36:41,940 --> 01:36:44,029
person is trying to understand this
proof for example what's the optimal

5016
01:36:44,029 --> 01:36:44,039
proof for example what's the optimal
 

5017
01:36:44,039 --> 01:36:45,620
proof for example what's the optimal
path to lead them through understanding

5018
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:45,630
path to lead them through understanding
 

5019
01:36:45,630 --> 01:36:48,080
path to lead them through understanding
that proof I suspect we will learn a lot

5020
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:48,090
that proof I suspect we will learn a lot
 

5021
01:36:48,090 --> 01:36:50,029
that proof I suspect we will learn a lot
more in probably a fairly small number

5022
01:36:50,029 --> 01:36:50,039
more in probably a fairly small number
 

5023
01:36:50,039 --> 01:36:52,549
more in probably a fairly small number
of years about that and it will be the

5024
01:36:52,549 --> 01:36:52,559
of years about that and it will be the
 

5025
01:36:52,559 --> 01:36:54,680
of years about that and it will be the
case that you know for example if you've

5026
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:54,690
case that you know for example if you've
 

5027
01:36:54,690 --> 01:36:57,859
case that you know for example if you've
got oh I don't know you can do simple

5028
01:36:57,859 --> 01:36:57,869
got oh I don't know you can do simple
 

5029
01:36:57,869 --> 01:36:59,660
got oh I don't know you can do simple
things like you know you go to Wikipedia

5030
01:36:59,660 --> 01:36:59,670
things like you know you go to Wikipedia
 

5031
01:36:59,670 --> 01:37:01,549
things like you know you go to Wikipedia
and you look at what the path of you

5032
01:37:01,549 --> 01:37:01,559
and you look at what the path of you
 

5033
01:37:01,559 --> 01:37:02,569
and you look at what the path of you
know how do you if you want to learn

5034
01:37:02,569 --> 01:37:02,579
know how do you if you want to learn
 

5035
01:37:02,579 --> 01:37:03,890
know how do you if you want to learn
this concept what other concepts you

5036
01:37:03,890 --> 01:37:03,900
this concept what other concepts you
 

5037
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:06,080
this concept what other concepts you
have to learn we have much more detailed

5038
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:06,090
have to learn we have much more detailed
 

5039
01:37:06,090 --> 01:37:08,029
have to learn we have much more detailed
symbolic information about what is

5040
01:37:08,029 --> 01:37:08,039
symbolic information about what is
 

5041
01:37:08,039 --> 01:37:10,149
symbolic information about what is
actually necessary to know in order to

5042
01:37:10,149 --> 01:37:10,159
actually necessary to know in order to
 

5043
01:37:10,159 --> 01:37:12,910
actually necessary to know in order to
understand this and so on it is I think

5044
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:12,920
understand this and so on it is I think
 

5045
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:15,470
understand this and so on it is I think
reasonably likely that we will be able

5046
01:37:15,470 --> 01:37:15,480
reasonably likely that we will be able
 

5047
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:17,810
reasonably likely that we will be able
to I mean you know if I look at I was

5048
01:37:17,810 --> 01:37:17,820
to I mean you know if I look at I was
 

5049
01:37:17,820 --> 01:37:19,160
to I mean you know if I look at I was
interested recently in the history of

5050
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:19,170
interested recently in the history of
 

5051
01:37:19,170 --> 01:37:21,080
interested recently in the history of
math education so I wanted to look at

5052
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:21,090
math education so I wanted to look at
 

5053
01:37:21,090 --> 01:37:23,299
math education so I wanted to look at
the complete sort of path of math

5054
01:37:23,299 --> 01:37:23,309
the complete sort of path of math
 

5055
01:37:23,309 --> 01:37:26,239
the complete sort of path of math
textbooks you know for the past well

5056
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:26,249
textbooks you know for the past well
 

5057
01:37:26,249 --> 01:37:29,479
textbooks you know for the past well
basically the like twelve hundred you

5058
01:37:29,479 --> 01:37:29,489
basically the like twelve hundred you
 

5059
01:37:29,489 --> 01:37:31,430
basically the like twelve hundred you
know people actually produced this one

5060
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:31,440
know people actually produced this one
 

5061
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:33,350
know people actually produced this one
of the early math textbooks so they've

5062
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:33,360
of the early math textbooks so they've
 

5063
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:34,520
of the early math textbooks so they've
been these different ways of teaching

5064
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:34,530
been these different ways of teaching
 

5065
01:37:34,530 --> 01:37:37,250
been these different ways of teaching
math and you know I think we've we've

5066
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:37,260
math and you know I think we've we've
 

5067
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:40,009
math and you know I think we've we've
gradually evolved a fairly optimized way

5068
01:37:40,009 --> 01:37:40,019
gradually evolved a fairly optimized way
 

5069
01:37:40,019 --> 01:37:41,810
gradually evolved a fairly optimized way
for the typical person though it's

5070
01:37:41,810 --> 01:37:41,820
for the typical person though it's
 

5071
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:43,970
for the typical person though it's
probably the variation of the population

5072
01:37:43,970 --> 01:37:43,980
probably the variation of the population
 

5073
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:46,009
probably the variation of the population
is not well understood for you know how

5074
01:37:46,009 --> 01:37:46,019
is not well understood for you know how
 

5075
01:37:46,019 --> 01:37:48,169
is not well understood for you know how
to explain certain concepts and we've

5076
01:37:48,169 --> 01:37:48,179
to explain certain concepts and we've
 

5077
01:37:48,179 --> 01:37:50,060
to explain certain concepts and we've
gone through some pretty weird ways of

5078
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:50,070
gone through some pretty weird ways of
 

5079
01:37:50,070 --> 01:37:52,009
gone through some pretty weird ways of
doing it from the 1600s and so on

5080
01:37:52,009 --> 01:37:52,019
doing it from the 1600s and so on
 

5081
01:37:52,019 --> 01:37:54,279
doing it from the 1600s and so on
where which have gone out of style and

5082
01:37:54,279 --> 01:37:54,289
where which have gone out of style and
 

5083
01:37:54,289 --> 01:37:56,299
where which have gone out of style and
possibly you know who knows whether

5084
01:37:56,299 --> 01:37:56,309
possibly you know who knows whether
 

5085
01:37:56,309 --> 01:37:59,270
possibly you know who knows whether
that's versus because of well but anyway

5086
01:37:59,270 --> 01:37:59,280
that's versus because of well but anyway
 

5087
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,040
that's versus because of well but anyway
so so you know we've kind of learnt this

5088
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:01,050
so so you know we've kind of learnt this
 

5089
01:38:01,050 --> 01:38:02,689
so so you know we've kind of learnt this
path of what's the optimal way to

5090
01:38:02,689 --> 01:38:02,699
path of what's the optimal way to
 

5091
01:38:02,699 --> 01:38:04,790
path of what's the optimal way to
explain adding fractions or something

5092
01:38:04,790 --> 01:38:04,800
explain adding fractions or something
 

5093
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:07,609
explain adding fractions or something
for humans for the typical human but I

5094
01:38:07,609 --> 01:38:07,619
for humans for the typical human but I
 

5095
01:38:07,619 --> 01:38:09,080
for humans for the typical human but I
think we'll learn a lot more about how

5096
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:09,090
think we'll learn a lot more about how
 

5097
01:38:09,090 --> 01:38:10,759
think we'll learn a lot more about how
you know by by essentially making a

5098
01:38:10,759 --> 01:38:10,769
you know by by essentially making a
 

5099
01:38:10,769 --> 01:38:13,040
you know by by essentially making a
model for the human a machine model for

5100
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:13,050
model for the human a machine model for
 

5101
01:38:13,050 --> 01:38:15,279
model for the human a machine model for
the human we'll learn more about how to

5102
01:38:15,279 --> 01:38:15,289
the human we'll learn more about how to
 

5103
01:38:15,289 --> 01:38:17,810
the human we'll learn more about how to
you know how to optimize how to explain

5104
01:38:17,810 --> 01:38:17,820
you know how to optimize how to explain
 

5105
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:20,899
you know how to optimize how to explain
stuff to humans a coming attraction but

5106
01:38:20,899 --> 01:38:20,909
stuff to humans a coming attraction but
 

5107
01:38:20,909 --> 01:38:23,180
stuff to humans a coming attraction but
Tim thanks by the way do you think we're

5108
01:38:23,180 --> 01:38:23,190
Tim thanks by the way do you think we're
 

5109
01:38:23,190 --> 01:38:25,430
Tim thanks by the way do you think we're
close to that at all because you you

5110
01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:25,440
close to that at all because you you
 

5111
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,979
close to that at all because you you
said that there's a something in Wolfram

5112
01:38:27,979 --> 01:38:27,989
said that there's a something in Wolfram
 

5113
01:38:27,989 --> 01:38:30,169
said that there's a something in Wolfram
Alpha that that presents the human a

5114
01:38:30,169 --> 01:38:30,179
Alpha that that presents the human a
 

5115
01:38:30,179 --> 01:38:34,189
Alpha that that presents the human a
nice way are we how far said attraction

5116
01:38:34,189 --> 01:38:34,199
nice way are we how far said attraction
 

5117
01:38:34,199 --> 01:38:38,299
nice way are we how far said attraction
yeah right so I mean in in that

5118
01:38:38,299 --> 01:38:38,309
yeah right so I mean in in that
 

5119
01:38:38,309 --> 01:38:41,359
yeah right so I mean in in that
explaining stuff to humans thing is a

5120
01:38:41,359 --> 01:38:41,369
explaining stuff to humans thing is a
 

5121
01:38:41,369 --> 01:38:43,700
explaining stuff to humans thing is a
lot of human work right now being able

5122
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:43,710
lot of human work right now being able
 

5123
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:44,780
lot of human work right now being able
to automate

5124
01:38:44,780 --> 01:38:44,790
to automate
 

5125
01:38:44,790 --> 01:38:48,140
to automate
explaining stuff to humans okay so some

5126
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:48,150
explaining stuff to humans okay so some
 

5127
01:38:48,150 --> 01:38:51,620
explaining stuff to humans okay so some
of these things let's see I mean so an

5128
01:38:51,620 --> 01:38:51,630
of these things let's see I mean so an
 

5129
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:54,590
of these things let's see I mean so an
interesting question actually just today

5130
01:38:54,590 --> 01:38:54,600
interesting question actually just today
 

5131
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:55,550
interesting question actually just today
I was working on something that's

5132
01:38:55,550 --> 01:38:55,560
I was working on something that's
 

5133
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:57,530
I was working on something that's
related to this yeah it's it's it's

5134
01:38:57,530 --> 01:38:57,540
related to this yeah it's it's it's
 

5135
01:38:57,540 --> 01:39:01,520
related to this yeah it's it's it's
being able to the question is given a

5136
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:01,530
being able to the question is given a
 

5137
01:39:01,530 --> 01:39:03,290
being able to the question is given a
whole bunch of can we for example train

5138
01:39:03,290 --> 01:39:03,300
whole bunch of can we for example train
 

5139
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:05,750
whole bunch of can we for example train
a machine learning system from

5140
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:05,760
a machine learning system from
 

5141
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:08,750
a machine learning system from
explanations that it can see roughly can

5142
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:08,760
explanations that it can see roughly can
 

5143
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:10,400
explanations that it can see roughly can
we train it to give explanations that

5144
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:10,410
we train it to give explanations that
 

5145
01:39:10,410 --> 01:39:12,770
we train it to give explanations that
are likely to be understandable maybe I

5146
01:39:12,770 --> 01:39:12,780
are likely to be understandable maybe I
 

5147
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:16,160
are likely to be understandable maybe I
think the okay so an example that I'd

5148
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:16,170
think the okay so an example that I'd
 

5149
01:39:16,170 --> 01:39:17,870
think the okay so an example that I'd
like to do okay I'd like to do a

5150
01:39:17,870 --> 01:39:17,880
like to do okay I'd like to do a
 

5151
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:20,690
like to do okay I'd like to do a
debugging assistant where the typical

5152
01:39:20,690 --> 01:39:20,700
debugging assistant where the typical
 

5153
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:22,520
debugging assistant where the typical
thing is program runs program gives

5154
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:22,530
thing is program runs program gives
 

5155
01:39:22,530 --> 01:39:25,280
thing is program runs program gives
wrong answer human says why did you get

5156
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:25,290
wrong answer human says why did you get
 

5157
01:39:25,290 --> 01:39:26,360
wrong answer human says why did you get
the wrong why did it give the wrong

5158
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:26,370
the wrong why did it give the wrong
 

5159
01:39:26,370 --> 01:39:28,220
the wrong why did it give the wrong
answer well the first piece of

5160
01:39:28,220 --> 01:39:28,230
answer well the first piece of
 

5161
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:29,960
answer well the first piece of
information to the computer is that was

5162
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:29,970
information to the computer is that was
 

5163
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:31,490
information to the computer is that was
the human thought that was the wrong

5164
01:39:31,490 --> 01:39:31,500
the human thought that was the wrong
 

5165
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:33,260
the human thought that was the wrong
answer because the computer just did

5166
01:39:33,260 --> 01:39:33,270
answer because the computer just did
 

5167
01:39:33,270 --> 01:39:35,360
answer because the computer just did
what it was told and it didn't know that

5168
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:35,370
what it was told and it didn't know that
 

5169
01:39:35,370 --> 01:39:36,650
what it was told and it didn't know that
was supposed to be the wrong answer so

5170
01:39:36,650 --> 01:39:36,660
was supposed to be the wrong answer so
 

5171
01:39:36,660 --> 01:39:39,020
was supposed to be the wrong answer so
then the question is can you in fact you

5172
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:39,030
then the question is can you in fact you
 

5173
01:39:39,030 --> 01:39:40,910
then the question is can you in fact you
know in that domain can you actually

5174
01:39:40,910 --> 01:39:40,920
know in that domain can you actually
 

5175
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:43,760
know in that domain can you actually
have a reasonable conversation in which

5176
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:43,770
have a reasonable conversation in which
 

5177
01:39:43,770 --> 01:39:46,040
have a reasonable conversation in which
the human is explaining the computer

5178
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:46,050
the human is explaining the computer
 

5179
01:39:46,050 --> 01:39:47,270
the human is explaining the computer
what they thought it was supposed to do

5180
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:47,280
what they thought it was supposed to do
 

5181
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,130
what they thought it was supposed to do
the computer is explaining what happened

5182
01:39:49,130 --> 01:39:49,140
the computer is explaining what happened
 

5183
01:39:49,140 --> 01:39:51,170
the computer is explaining what happened
and why did it happen and so on same

5184
01:39:51,170 --> 01:39:51,180
and why did it happen and so on same
 

5185
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:53,870
and why did it happen and so on same
kind of thing for math tutoring you know

5186
01:39:53,870 --> 01:39:53,880
kind of thing for math tutoring you know
 

5187
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:55,790
kind of thing for math tutoring you know
we have a lot of you know we've got a

5188
01:39:55,790 --> 01:39:55,800
we have a lot of you know we've got a
 

5189
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:58,190
we have a lot of you know we've got a
lot of stuff you know we're sort of very

5190
01:39:58,190 --> 01:39:58,200
lot of stuff you know we're sort of very
 

5191
01:39:58,200 --> 01:39:59,750
lot of stuff you know we're sort of very
widely used for people who want to

5192
01:39:59,750 --> 01:39:59,760
widely used for people who want to
 

5193
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,450
widely used for people who want to
understand the steps in math you know

5194
01:40:02,450 --> 01:40:02,460
understand the steps in math you know
 

5195
01:40:02,460 --> 01:40:04,370
understand the steps in math you know
can we make a thing where people tell us

5196
01:40:04,370 --> 01:40:04,380
can we make a thing where people tell us
 

5197
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:06,500
can we make a thing where people tell us
I think it's this okay I'll tell you one

5198
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:06,510
I think it's this okay I'll tell you one
 

5199
01:40:06,510 --> 01:40:08,180
I think it's this okay I'll tell you one
one little factoid which I which you did

5200
01:40:08,180 --> 01:40:08,190
one little factoid which I which you did
 

5201
01:40:08,190 --> 01:40:10,729
one little factoid which I which you did
work out so if you do multi digit

5202
01:40:10,729 --> 01:40:10,739
work out so if you do multi digit
 

5203
01:40:10,739 --> 01:40:13,070
work out so if you do multi digit
arithmetic multi-digit addition okay

5204
01:40:13,070 --> 01:40:13,080
arithmetic multi-digit addition okay
 

5205
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:17,330
arithmetic multi-digit addition okay
okay so the basis of this is its kind of

5206
01:40:17,330 --> 01:40:17,340
okay so the basis of this is its kind of
 

5207
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:19,220
okay so the basis of this is its kind of
silly silly thing but you know if you

5208
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:19,230
silly silly thing but you know if you
 

5209
01:40:19,230 --> 01:40:20,690
silly silly thing but you know if you
get the right answer for an addition

5210
01:40:20,690 --> 01:40:20,700
get the right answer for an addition
 

5211
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:22,880
get the right answer for an addition
some okay you don't get very much

5212
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:22,890
some okay you don't get very much
 

5213
01:40:22,890 --> 01:40:24,950
some okay you don't get very much
information the student gives the wrong

5214
01:40:24,950 --> 01:40:24,960
information the student gives the wrong
 

5215
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,170
information the student gives the wrong
answer the question is can you tell them

5216
01:40:27,170 --> 01:40:27,180
answer the question is can you tell them
 

5217
01:40:27,180 --> 01:40:29,300
answer the question is can you tell them
where they went wrong so let's say you

5218
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:29,310
where they went wrong so let's say you
 

5219
01:40:29,310 --> 01:40:31,610
where they went wrong so let's say you
have a four digit addition sum and the

5220
01:40:31,610 --> 01:40:31,620
have a four digit addition sum and the
 

5221
01:40:31,620 --> 01:40:33,620
have a four digit addition sum and the
student gives the wrong answer can you

5222
01:40:33,620 --> 01:40:33,630
student gives the wrong answer can you
 

5223
01:40:33,630 --> 01:40:35,210
student gives the wrong answer can you
back trace and figure out what they

5224
01:40:35,210 --> 01:40:35,220
back trace and figure out what they
 

5225
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:36,650
back trace and figure out what they
likely did wrong and the answer is you

5226
01:40:36,650 --> 01:40:36,660
likely did wrong and the answer is you
 

5227
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:39,320
likely did wrong and the answer is you
can you know you just make this graph of

5228
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:39,330
can you know you just make this graph of
 

5229
01:40:39,330 --> 01:40:40,700
can you know you just make this graph of
all the different things that can happen

5230
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:40,710
all the different things that can happen
 

5231
01:40:40,710 --> 01:40:43,340
all the different things that can happen
you know when did they you know there's

5232
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:43,350
you know when did they you know there's
 

5233
01:40:43,350 --> 01:40:44,479
you know when did they you know there's
certain things that are more common

5234
01:40:44,479 --> 01:40:44,489
certain things that are more common
 

5235
01:40:44,489 --> 01:40:46,310
certain things that are more common
transposing numbers and things or you

5236
01:40:46,310 --> 01:40:46,320
transposing numbers and things or you
 

5237
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:48,860
transposing numbers and things or you
know having a 1 and a 7 mixed up those

5238
01:40:48,860 --> 01:40:48,870
know having a 1 and a 7 mixed up those
 

5239
01:40:48,870 --> 01:40:50,900
know having a 1 and a 7 mixed up those
kinds of things you can with very high

5240
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:50,910
kinds of things you can with very high
 

5241
01:40:50,910 --> 01:40:53,030
kinds of things you can with very high
power let's say given a for de division

5242
01:40:53,030 --> 01:40:53,040
power let's say given a for de division
 

5243
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:55,400
power let's say given a for de division
some with the wrong answer you can say

5244
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:55,410
some with the wrong answer you can say
 

5245
01:40:55,410 --> 01:40:57,060
some with the wrong answer you can say
this is the mistake you made

5246
01:40:57,060 --> 01:40:57,070
this is the mistake you made
 

5247
01:40:57,070 --> 01:40:59,460
this is the mistake you made
which is sort of interesting and that's

5248
01:40:59,460 --> 01:40:59,470
which is sort of interesting and that's
 

5249
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:01,560
which is sort of interesting and that's
you know being done in a fairly symbolic

5250
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:01,570
you know being done in a fairly symbolic
 

5251
01:41:01,570 --> 01:41:04,860
you know being done in a fairly symbolic
way whether one can do that in a you

5252
01:41:04,860 --> 01:41:04,870
way whether one can do that in a you
 

5253
01:41:04,870 --> 01:41:06,600
way whether one can do that in a you
know more machine learning kind of way

5254
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:06,610
know more machine learning kind of way
 

5255
01:41:06,610 --> 01:41:08,700
know more machine learning kind of way
for more complicated derivations I'm not

5256
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:08,710
for more complicated derivations I'm not
 

5257
01:41:08,710 --> 01:41:13,100
for more complicated derivations I'm not
sure but that's a that's one that works

5258
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:13,110

 

5259
01:41:13,110 --> 01:41:15,420

are you sir I just had a follow-up

5260
01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:15,430
are you sir I just had a follow-up
 

5261
01:41:15,430 --> 01:41:18,720
are you sir I just had a follow-up
question so do you think you know like

5262
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:18,730
question so do you think you know like
 

5263
01:41:18,730 --> 01:41:21,240
question so do you think you know like
in the future this is it possible to

5264
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:21,250
in the future this is it possible to
 

5265
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:24,030
in the future this is it possible to
simulate virtual environments which can

5266
01:41:24,030 --> 01:41:24,040
simulate virtual environments which can
 

5267
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:26,340
simulate virtual environments which can
actually understand how the human mind

5268
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:26,350
actually understand how the human mind
 

5269
01:41:26,350 --> 01:41:29,070
actually understand how the human mind
works and then build you know like

5270
01:41:29,070 --> 01:41:29,080
works and then build you know like
 

5271
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:30,840
works and then build you know like
finite state machines inside of this

5272
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:30,850
finite state machines inside of this
 

5273
01:41:30,850 --> 01:41:34,920
finite state machines inside of this
virtual environment to provide a better

5274
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:34,930
virtual environment to provide a better
 

5275
01:41:34,930 --> 01:41:36,420
virtual environment to provide a better
learning experience and a more

5276
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:36,430
learning experience and a more
 

5277
01:41:36,430 --> 01:41:39,300
learning experience and a more
personalized learning experience well I

5278
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:39,310
personalized learning experience well I
 

5279
01:41:39,310 --> 01:41:41,490
personalized learning experience well I
mean so the question is if if you're

5280
01:41:41,490 --> 01:41:41,500
mean so the question is if if you're
 

5281
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:44,730
mean so the question is if if you're
going to you know can you optimize if

5282
01:41:44,730 --> 01:41:44,740
going to you know can you optimize if
 

5283
01:41:44,740 --> 01:41:45,900
going to you know can you optimize if
you're playing a video game or something

5284
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:45,910
you're playing a video game or something
 

5285
01:41:45,910 --> 01:41:47,400
you're playing a video game or something
and that video game is supposed to be

5286
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:47,410
and that video game is supposed to be
 

5287
01:41:47,410 --> 01:41:50,400
and that video game is supposed to be
educational can you optimize the the

5288
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:50,410
educational can you optimize the the
 

5289
01:41:50,410 --> 01:41:53,550
educational can you optimize the the
experience based on a model of you so to

5290
01:41:53,550 --> 01:41:53,560
experience based on a model of you so to
 

5291
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:55,440
experience based on a model of you so to
speak yeah I'm sure the answer is yes

5292
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:55,450
speak yeah I'm sure the answer is yes
 

5293
01:41:55,450 --> 01:41:57,930
speak yeah I'm sure the answer is yes
and I'm sure the you know the question

5294
01:41:57,930 --> 01:41:57,940
and I'm sure the you know the question
 

5295
01:41:57,940 --> 01:41:59,730
and I'm sure the you know the question
of how complicated the model of you will

5296
01:41:59,730 --> 01:41:59,740
of how complicated the model of you will
 

5297
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:01,860
of how complicated the model of you will
be is an interesting question I don't

5298
01:42:01,860 --> 01:42:01,870
be is an interesting question I don't
 

5299
01:42:01,870 --> 01:42:03,540
be is an interesting question I don't
know the answer to I mean I've I've kind

5300
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:03,550
know the answer to I mean I've I've kind
 

5301
01:42:03,550 --> 01:42:05,730
know the answer to I mean I've I've kind
of wanted a similar question so I I'm a

5302
01:42:05,730 --> 01:42:05,740
of wanted a similar question so I I'm a
 

5303
01:42:05,740 --> 01:42:08,100
of wanted a similar question so I I'm a
kind of personal analytics enthusiast so

5304
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:08,110
kind of personal analytics enthusiast so
 

5305
01:42:08,110 --> 01:42:10,380
kind of personal analytics enthusiast so
I collect tons of data about myself and

5306
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:10,390
I collect tons of data about myself and
 

5307
01:42:10,390 --> 01:42:12,390
I collect tons of data about myself and
I mean I do it mostly because it's been

5308
01:42:12,390 --> 01:42:12,400
I mean I do it mostly because it's been
 

5309
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:13,890
I mean I do it mostly because it's been
super easy to do and I've done it for

5310
01:42:13,890 --> 01:42:13,900
super easy to do and I've done it for
 

5311
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:16,020
super easy to do and I've done it for
like 30 years and I have you know every

5312
01:42:16,020 --> 01:42:16,030
like 30 years and I have you know every
 

5313
01:42:16,030 --> 01:42:17,850
like 30 years and I have you know every
keystroke I've typed on a computer like

5314
01:42:17,850 --> 01:42:17,860
keystroke I've typed on a computer like
 

5315
01:42:17,860 --> 01:42:19,410
keystroke I've typed on a computer like
every keystroke I've typed here and I

5316
01:42:19,410 --> 01:42:19,420
every keystroke I've typed here and I
 

5317
01:42:19,420 --> 01:42:22,110
every keystroke I've typed here and I
the screen of my computer every every 30

5318
01:42:22,110 --> 01:42:22,120
the screen of my computer every every 30
 

5319
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:24,300
the screen of my computer every every 30
seconds or so of maybe 15 seconds I'm

5320
01:42:24,300 --> 01:42:24,310
seconds or so of maybe 15 seconds I'm
 

5321
01:42:24,310 --> 01:42:26,550
seconds or so of maybe 15 seconds I'm
not sure it there's a screen shot it's a

5322
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:26,560
not sure it there's a screen shot it's a
 

5323
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,530
not sure it there's a screen shot it's a
super boring movie to watch but anyway

5324
01:42:28,530 --> 01:42:28,540
super boring movie to watch but anyway
 

5325
01:42:28,540 --> 01:42:30,300
super boring movie to watch but anyway
I've been collecting all this stuff and

5326
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:30,310
I've been collecting all this stuff and
 

5327
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:33,000
I've been collecting all this stuff and
so a question that I've asked is is

5328
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:33,010
so a question that I've asked is is
 

5329
01:42:33,010 --> 01:42:35,460
so a question that I've asked is is
there enough data that a bot of me could

5330
01:42:35,460 --> 01:42:35,470
there enough data that a bot of me could
 

5331
01:42:35,470 --> 01:42:38,430
there enough data that a bot of me could
be made in other words do I have enough

5332
01:42:38,430 --> 01:42:38,440
be made in other words do I have enough
 

5333
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:41,040
be made in other words do I have enough
data about you know I've got I've

5334
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:41,050
data about you know I've got I've
 

5335
01:42:41,050 --> 01:42:43,920
data about you know I've got I've
written a million emails I have all of

5336
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:43,930
written a million emails I have all of
 

5337
01:42:43,930 --> 01:42:46,130
written a million emails I have all of
those I've received three million emails

5338
01:42:46,130 --> 01:42:46,140
those I've received three million emails
 

5339
01:42:46,140 --> 01:42:49,380
those I've received three million emails
over that period of time I've got you

5340
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:49,390
over that period of time I've got you
 

5341
01:42:49,390 --> 01:42:51,510
over that period of time I've got you
know endless you know things I've typed

5342
01:42:51,510 --> 01:42:51,520
know endless you know things I've typed
 

5343
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:54,060
know endless you know things I've typed
etc etcetera etcetera you know is there

5344
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:54,070
etc etcetera etcetera you know is there
 

5345
01:42:54,070 --> 01:42:57,630
etc etcetera etcetera you know is there
enough data to reconstruct you know me

5346
01:42:57,630 --> 01:42:57,640
enough data to reconstruct you know me
 

5347
01:42:57,640 --> 01:43:00,480
enough data to reconstruct you know me
basically I think the answer is probably

5348
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:00,490
basically I think the answer is probably
 

5349
01:43:00,490 --> 01:43:03,090
basically I think the answer is probably
yes not sure but I think the answer is

5350
01:43:03,090 --> 01:43:03,100
yes not sure but I think the answer is
 

5351
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:05,910
yes not sure but I think the answer is
probably yes and so the question is in

5352
01:43:05,910 --> 01:43:05,920
probably yes and so the question is in
 

5353
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:07,290
probably yes and so the question is in
an environment where you are interacting

5354
01:43:07,290 --> 01:43:07,300
an environment where you are interacting
 

5355
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:08,760
an environment where you are interacting
with some video game trying to learn

5356
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:08,770
with some video game trying to learn
 

5357
01:43:08,770 --> 01:43:10,560
with some video game trying to learn
something whatever else you know

5358
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:10,570
something whatever else you know
 

5359
01:43:10,570 --> 01:43:12,180
something whatever else you know
how long is it going to be before it can

5360
01:43:12,180 --> 01:43:12,190
how long is it going to be before it can
 

5361
01:43:12,190 --> 01:43:14,399
how long is it going to be before it can
learn enough about you to change that

5362
01:43:14,399 --> 01:43:14,409
learn enough about you to change that
 

5363
01:43:14,409 --> 01:43:15,839
learn enough about you to change that
environment in a way that's useful for

5364
01:43:15,839 --> 01:43:15,849
environment in a way that's useful for
 

5365
01:43:15,849 --> 01:43:18,359
environment in a way that's useful for
explaining the next thing to you I would

5366
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:18,369
explaining the next thing to you I would
 

5367
01:43:18,369 --> 01:43:21,209
explaining the next thing to you I would
guess I would guess that have done that

5368
01:43:21,209 --> 01:43:21,219
guess I would guess that have done that
 

5369
01:43:21,219 --> 01:43:23,910
guess I would guess that have done that
this is comparatively easy I might be

5370
01:43:23,910 --> 01:43:23,920
this is comparatively easy I might be
 

5371
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:27,660
this is comparatively easy I might be
wrong but that and that the I mean I

5372
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:27,670
wrong but that and that the I mean I
 

5373
01:43:27,670 --> 01:43:28,919
wrong but that and that the I mean I
think you know it's an interesting thing

5374
01:43:28,919 --> 01:43:28,929
think you know it's an interesting thing
 

5375
01:43:28,929 --> 01:43:31,109
think you know it's an interesting thing
because you know once dealing with you

5376
01:43:31,109 --> 01:43:31,119
because you know once dealing with you
 

5377
01:43:31,119 --> 01:43:32,189
because you know once dealing with you
know there's a space of human

5378
01:43:32,189 --> 01:43:32,199
know there's a space of human
 

5379
01:43:32,199 --> 01:43:33,930
know there's a space of human
personalities there's a space of human

5380
01:43:33,930 --> 01:43:33,940
personalities there's a space of human
 

5381
01:43:33,940 --> 01:43:36,419
personalities there's a space of human
learning styles you know I'm sort of

5382
01:43:36,419 --> 01:43:36,429
learning styles you know I'm sort of
 

5383
01:43:36,429 --> 01:43:37,709
learning styles you know I'm sort of
always interested in the space of all

5384
01:43:37,709 --> 01:43:37,719
always interested in the space of all
 

5385
01:43:37,719 --> 01:43:40,890
always interested in the space of all
possible XYZ and there's you know

5386
01:43:40,890 --> 01:43:40,900
possible XYZ and there's you know
 

5387
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:42,240
possible XYZ and there's you know
there's that question over how do you

5388
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:42,250
there's that question over how do you
 

5389
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:43,800
there's that question over how do you
parameterize the space of all possible

5390
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:43,810
parameterize the space of all possible
 

5391
01:43:43,810 --> 01:43:46,919
parameterize the space of all possible
human learning styles and is there a way

5392
01:43:46,919 --> 01:43:46,929
human learning styles and is there a way
 

5393
01:43:46,929 --> 01:43:50,520
human learning styles and is there a way
that we will learn you know like can we

5394
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:50,530
that we will learn you know like can we
 

5395
01:43:50,530 --> 01:43:52,770
that we will learn you know like can we
do that symbolically and say these are

5396
01:43:52,770 --> 01:43:52,780
do that symbolically and say these are
 

5397
01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:54,750
do that symbolically and say these are
ten learning styles or is it something I

5398
01:43:54,750 --> 01:43:54,760
ten learning styles or is it something I
 

5399
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:56,910
ten learning styles or is it something I
think that's a case where it's better to

5400
01:43:56,910 --> 01:43:56,920
think that's a case where it's better to
 

5401
01:43:56,920 --> 01:44:00,479
think that's a case where it's better to
use you know sort of soft machine

5402
01:44:00,479 --> 01:44:00,489
use you know sort of soft machine
 

5403
01:44:00,489 --> 01:44:03,300
use you know sort of soft machine
learning type methods to kind of feel

5404
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:03,310
learning type methods to kind of feel
 

5405
01:44:03,310 --> 01:44:09,149
learning type methods to kind of feel
out that space well you know maybe very

5406
01:44:09,149 --> 01:44:09,159
out that space well you know maybe very
 

5407
01:44:09,159 --> 01:44:12,330
out that space well you know maybe very
last question I was just intuitively

5408
01:44:12,330 --> 01:44:12,340
last question I was just intuitively
 

5409
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:14,580
last question I was just intuitively
thinking when you spoke about an ocean I

5410
01:44:14,580 --> 01:44:14,590
thinking when you spoke about an ocean I
 

5411
01:44:14,590 --> 01:44:18,270
thinking when you spoke about an ocean I
thought of Isaac Newton when he said I

5412
01:44:18,270 --> 01:44:18,280
thought of Isaac Newton when he said I
 

5413
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:21,180
thought of Isaac Newton when he said I
mean you know the famous quote I might

5414
01:44:21,180 --> 01:44:21,190
mean you know the famous quote I might
 

5415
01:44:21,190 --> 01:44:24,300
mean you know the famous quote I might
not and I thought instead of Newton on

5416
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:24,310
not and I thought instead of Newton on
 

5417
01:44:24,310 --> 01:44:27,080
not and I thought instead of Newton on
the beach what if franz liszt were there

5418
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:27,090
the beach what if franz liszt were there
 

5419
01:44:27,090 --> 01:44:30,120
the beach what if franz liszt were there
what question would he ask what would he

5420
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:30,130
what question would he ask what would he
 

5421
01:44:30,130 --> 01:44:30,720
what question would he ask what would he
say

5422
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:30,730
say
 

5423
01:44:30,730 --> 01:44:34,620
say
and I'm trying to understand you're the

5424
01:44:34,620 --> 01:44:34,630
and I'm trying to understand you're the
 

5425
01:44:34,630 --> 01:44:39,479
and I'm trying to understand you're the
alien ocean and humans through maybe

5426
01:44:39,479 --> 01:44:39,489
alien ocean and humans through maybe
 

5427
01:44:39,489 --> 01:44:44,310
alien ocean and humans through maybe
Franz Liszt and music well so I mean the

5428
01:44:44,310 --> 01:44:44,320
Franz Liszt and music well so I mean the
 

5429
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:47,550
Franz Liszt and music well so I mean the
the quote from Newton is is some sort of

5430
01:44:47,550 --> 01:44:47,560
the quote from Newton is is some sort of
 

5431
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:48,870
the quote from Newton is is some sort of
an interesting quote I think it goes

5432
01:44:48,870 --> 01:44:48,880
an interesting quote I think it goes
 

5433
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:53,520
an interesting quote I think it goes
something like this if you know people

5434
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:53,530
something like this if you know people
 

5435
01:44:53,530 --> 01:44:55,290
something like this if you know people
are talking about how wonderful calculus

5436
01:44:55,290 --> 01:44:55,300
are talking about how wonderful calculus
 

5437
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:57,209
are talking about how wonderful calculus
and all that kind of thing are and

5438
01:44:57,209 --> 01:44:57,219
and all that kind of thing are and
 

5439
01:44:57,219 --> 01:45:00,540
and all that kind of thing are and
Newton says you know to others I may

5440
01:45:00,540 --> 01:45:00,550
Newton says you know to others I may
 

5441
01:45:00,550 --> 01:45:01,950
Newton says you know to others I may
seem like I've done a lot of stuff but

5442
01:45:01,950 --> 01:45:01,960
seem like I've done a lot of stuff but
 

5443
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:04,620
seem like I've done a lot of stuff but
to me I seem like a child who who picked

5444
01:45:04,620 --> 01:45:04,630
to me I seem like a child who who picked
 

5445
01:45:04,630 --> 01:45:06,720
to me I seem like a child who who picked
up a particularly elegant you know

5446
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:06,730
up a particularly elegant you know
 

5447
01:45:06,730 --> 01:45:09,180
up a particularly elegant you know
seashell on the on the beach and I've

5448
01:45:09,180 --> 01:45:09,190
seashell on the on the beach and I've
 

5449
01:45:09,190 --> 01:45:11,129
seashell on the on the beach and I've
been studying this this seashell for a

5450
01:45:11,129 --> 01:45:11,139
been studying this this seashell for a
 

5451
01:45:11,139 --> 01:45:13,109
been studying this this seashell for a
while even though there's this ocean of

5452
01:45:13,109 --> 01:45:13,119
while even though there's this ocean of
 

5453
01:45:13,119 --> 01:45:14,280
while even though there's this ocean of
truth out there waiting to be discovered

5454
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:14,290
truth out there waiting to be discovered
 

5455
01:45:14,290 --> 01:45:16,379
truth out there waiting to be discovered
that's roughly the quote okay

5456
01:45:16,379 --> 01:45:16,389
that's roughly the quote okay
 

5457
01:45:16,389 --> 01:45:19,319
that's roughly the quote okay
I find that quote interesting for the

5458
01:45:19,319 --> 01:45:19,329
I find that quote interesting for the
 

5459
01:45:19,329 --> 01:45:22,410
I find that quote interesting for the
following reason the what Newton did was

5460
01:45:22,410 --> 01:45:22,420
following reason the what Newton did was
 

5461
01:45:22,420 --> 01:45:24,300
following reason the what Newton did was
you know calculus and things like

5462
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:24,310
you know calculus and things like
 

5463
01:45:24,310 --> 01:45:26,520
you know calculus and things like
kit if you look at the computational

5464
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:26,530
kit if you look at the computational
 

5465
01:45:26,530 --> 01:45:28,830
kit if you look at the computational
universe of all possible programs there

5466
01:45:28,830 --> 01:45:28,840
universe of all possible programs there
 

5467
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:30,960
universe of all possible programs there
is a small corner Newton was exactly

5468
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:30,970
is a small corner Newton was exactly
 

5469
01:45:30,970 --> 01:45:33,150
is a small corner Newton was exactly
right and what he said that is he picked

5470
01:45:33,150 --> 01:45:33,160
right and what he said that is he picked
 

5471
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:35,820
right and what he said that is he picked
off calculus which is a corner of the

5472
01:45:35,820 --> 01:45:35,830
off calculus which is a corner of the
 

5473
01:45:35,830 --> 01:45:37,860
off calculus which is a corner of the
possible things that can happen in the

5474
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:37,870
possible things that can happen in the
 

5475
01:45:37,870 --> 01:45:40,050
possible things that can happen in the
computational universe that happened to

5476
01:45:40,050 --> 01:45:40,060
computational universe that happened to
 

5477
01:45:40,060 --> 01:45:42,360
computational universe that happened to
be an elegant seashell so to speak they

5478
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:42,370
be an elegant seashell so to speak they
 

5479
01:45:42,370 --> 01:45:43,980
be an elegant seashell so to speak they
happened to be a case where you can

5480
01:45:43,980 --> 01:45:43,990
happened to be a case where you can
 

5481
01:45:43,990 --> 01:45:46,560
happened to be a case where you can
figure out what's going on and and so on

5482
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:46,570
figure out what's going on and and so on
 

5483
01:45:46,570 --> 01:45:48,410
figure out what's going on and and so on
while there is still a sort of ocean of

5484
01:45:48,410 --> 01:45:48,420
while there is still a sort of ocean of
 

5485
01:45:48,420 --> 01:45:51,840
while there is still a sort of ocean of
of other sort of computational

5486
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:51,850
of other sort of computational
 

5487
01:45:51,850 --> 01:45:53,910
of other sort of computational
possibilities out there but but when it

5488
01:45:53,910 --> 01:45:53,920
possibilities out there but but when it
 

5489
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,110
possibilities out there but but when it
comes to you know you're asking about

5490
01:45:55,110 --> 01:45:55,120
comes to you know you're asking about
 

5491
01:45:55,120 --> 01:45:57,450
comes to you know you're asking about
music I I think my computer stopped

5492
01:45:57,450 --> 01:45:57,460
music I I think my computer stopped
 

5493
01:45:57,460 --> 01:45:59,960
music I I think my computer stopped
being able to get anywhere but but um

5494
01:45:59,960 --> 01:45:59,970
being able to get anywhere but but um
 

5495
01:45:59,970 --> 01:46:04,020
being able to get anywhere but but um
sort of interesting the cific get to the

5496
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:04,030
sort of interesting the cific get to the
 

5497
01:46:04,030 --> 01:46:07,800
sort of interesting the cific get to the
site yeah so this is a this is a website

5498
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:07,810
site yeah so this is a this is a website
 

5499
01:46:07,810 --> 01:46:11,880
site yeah so this is a this is a website
that we made years ago and now my

5500
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:11,890
that we made years ago and now my
 

5501
01:46:11,890 --> 01:46:15,480
that we made years ago and now my
computer isn't playing anything but

5502
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:15,490

 

5503
01:46:15,490 --> 01:46:18,770

[Music]

5504
01:46:18,770 --> 01:46:18,780
[Music]
 

5505
01:46:18,780 --> 01:46:25,710
[Music]
let's try that okay so these things are

5506
01:46:25,710 --> 01:46:25,720
let's try that okay so these things are
 

5507
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:28,260
let's try that okay so these things are
created by basically just searching

5508
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:28,270
created by basically just searching
 

5509
01:46:28,270 --> 01:46:29,700
created by basically just searching
computational universe for possible

5510
01:46:29,700 --> 01:46:29,710
computational universe for possible
 

5511
01:46:29,710 --> 01:46:31,650
computational universe for possible
programs it's sort of interesting

5512
01:46:31,650 --> 01:46:31,660
programs it's sort of interesting
 

5513
01:46:31,660 --> 01:46:34,140
programs it's sort of interesting
because everyone has kind of a story

5514
01:46:34,140 --> 01:46:34,150
because everyone has kind of a story
 

5515
01:46:34,150 --> 01:46:35,430
because everyone has kind of a story
some of them are look more interesting

5516
01:46:35,430 --> 01:46:35,440
some of them are look more interesting
 

5517
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:44,360
some of them are look more interesting
than others let's try that one

5518
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:44,370

 

5519
01:46:44,370 --> 01:46:48,370

anyway the the what's what's interesting

5520
01:46:48,370 --> 01:46:48,380
anyway the the what's what's interesting
 

5521
01:46:48,380 --> 01:46:50,270
anyway the the what's what's interesting
actually what was interesting to me

5522
01:46:50,270 --> 01:46:50,280
actually what was interesting to me
 

5523
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:52,490
actually what was interesting to me
about this was this is a very trivial

5524
01:46:52,490 --> 01:46:52,500
about this was this is a very trivial
 

5525
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:54,380
about this was this is a very trivial
you know what this is doing is very

5526
01:46:54,380 --> 01:46:54,390
you know what this is doing is very
 

5527
01:46:54,390 --> 01:46:56,630
you know what this is doing is very
trivial at some level it's just it

5528
01:46:56,630 --> 01:46:56,640
trivial at some level it's just it
 

5529
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:57,800
trivial at some level it's just it
actually happens to use cellular

5530
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:57,810
actually happens to use cellular
 

5531
01:46:57,810 --> 01:47:00,140
actually happens to use cellular
automata you can even have it show you I

5532
01:47:00,140 --> 01:47:00,150
automata you can even have it show you I
 

5533
01:47:00,150 --> 01:47:02,600
automata you can even have it show you I
think someplace here where is it

5534
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:02,610
think someplace here where is it
 

5535
01:47:02,610 --> 01:47:03,980
think someplace here where is it
somewhere there's a way of showing your

5536
01:47:03,980 --> 01:47:03,990
somewhere there's a way of showing your
 

5537
01:47:03,990 --> 01:47:06,080
somewhere there's a way of showing your
show the evolution this is this is

5538
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:06,090
show the evolution this is this is
 

5539
01:47:06,090 --> 01:47:07,880
show the evolution this is this is
showing the behind the scenes what was

5540
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:07,890
showing the behind the scenes what was
 

5541
01:47:07,890 --> 01:47:10,670
showing the behind the scenes what was
actually happening what it chose to use

5542
01:47:10,670 --> 01:47:10,680
actually happening what it chose to use
 

5543
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:14,260
actually happening what it chose to use
to generate that musical piece um and

5544
01:47:14,260 --> 01:47:14,270
to generate that musical piece um and
 

5545
01:47:14,270 --> 01:47:16,340
to generate that musical piece um and
what I thought was interesting about the

5546
01:47:16,340 --> 01:47:16,350
what I thought was interesting about the
 

5547
01:47:16,350 --> 01:47:20,060
what I thought was interesting about the
site I thought well you know how would

5548
01:47:20,060 --> 01:47:20,070
site I thought well you know how would
 

5549
01:47:20,070 --> 01:47:22,010
site I thought well you know how would
computers be relevant to music etcetera

5550
01:47:22,010 --> 01:47:22,020
computers be relevant to music etcetera
 

5551
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:23,480
computers be relevant to music etcetera
etcetera etcetera well you know what

5552
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:23,490
etcetera etcetera well you know what
 

5553
01:47:23,490 --> 01:47:25,400
etcetera etcetera well you know what
would happen is a human would have an

5554
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:25,410
would happen is a human would have an
 

5555
01:47:25,410 --> 01:47:27,440
would happen is a human would have an
idea and then the computer would kind of

5556
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:27,450
idea and then the computer would kind of
 

5557
01:47:27,450 --> 01:47:29,900
idea and then the computer would kind of
dressup that idea and then you know a

5558
01:47:29,900 --> 01:47:29,910
dressup that idea and then you know a
 

5559
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:32,390
dressup that idea and then you know a
bunch of years go by and I talked to

5560
01:47:32,390 --> 01:47:32,400
bunch of years go by and I talked to
 

5561
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:34,700
bunch of years go by and I talked to
people you know who composers and things

5562
01:47:34,700 --> 01:47:34,710
people you know who composers and things
 

5563
01:47:34,710 --> 01:47:36,260
people you know who composers and things
and they say oh yeah I really like that

5564
01:47:36,260 --> 01:47:36,270
and they say oh yeah I really like that
 

5565
01:47:36,270 --> 01:47:39,350
and they say oh yeah I really like that
wolfram tones site okay that's nice they

5566
01:47:39,350 --> 01:47:39,360
wolfram tones site okay that's nice they
 

5567
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:41,690
wolfram tones site okay that's nice they
say it's a very good place for me to get

5568
01:47:41,690 --> 01:47:41,700
say it's a very good place for me to get
 

5569
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:45,050
say it's a very good place for me to get
ideas so that's sort of the opposite of

5570
01:47:45,050 --> 01:47:45,060
ideas so that's sort of the opposite of
 

5571
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:47,360
ideas so that's sort of the opposite of
what I would have expected namely what's

5572
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:47,370
what I would have expected namely what's
 

5573
01:47:47,370 --> 01:47:50,150
what I would have expected namely what's
happening is you know human comes here

5574
01:47:50,150 --> 01:47:50,160
happening is you know human comes here
 

5575
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:53,420
happening is you know human comes here
you know listens to some 10-second

5576
01:47:53,420 --> 01:47:53,430
you know listens to some 10-second
 

5577
01:47:53,430 --> 01:47:56,240
you know listens to some 10-second
fragment and they said oh that's an

5578
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:56,250
fragment and they said oh that's an
 

5579
01:47:56,250 --> 01:47:57,980
fragment and they said oh that's an
interesting idea and then they kind of

5580
01:47:57,980 --> 01:47:57,990
interesting idea and then they kind of
 

5581
01:47:57,990 --> 01:48:00,590
interesting idea and then they kind of
embellish it using kind of something

5582
01:48:00,590 --> 01:48:00,600
embellish it using kind of something
 

5583
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:02,720
embellish it using kind of something
that is humanly meaningful but it's like

5584
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:02,730
that is humanly meaningful but it's like
 

5585
01:48:02,730 --> 01:48:04,850
that is humanly meaningful but it's like
you know you're taking a photograph and

5586
01:48:04,850 --> 01:48:04,860
you know you're taking a photograph and
 

5587
01:48:04,860 --> 01:48:06,560
you know you're taking a photograph and
you see some interesting configuration

5588
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:06,570
you see some interesting configuration
 

5589
01:48:06,570 --> 01:48:09,080
you see some interesting configuration
and then kind of you're you know you're

5590
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:09,090
and then kind of you're you know you're
 

5591
01:48:09,090 --> 01:48:10,870
and then kind of you're you know you're
filling that with kind of some human

5592
01:48:10,870 --> 01:48:10,880
filling that with kind of some human
 

5593
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:16,520
filling that with kind of some human
sort of context but but so I'm not quite

5594
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:16,530
sort of context but but so I'm not quite
 

5595
01:48:16,530 --> 01:48:21,800
sort of context but but so I'm not quite
sure what what you were asking about I I

5596
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:21,810
sure what what you were asking about I I
 

5597
01:48:21,810 --> 01:48:24,380
sure what what you were asking about I I
mean back to the Newton quote the thing

5598
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:24,390
mean back to the Newton quote the thing
 

5599
01:48:24,390 --> 01:48:27,110
mean back to the Newton quote the thing
that I think is some another way to

5600
01:48:27,110 --> 01:48:27,120
that I think is some another way to
 

5601
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:30,830
that I think is some another way to
think about that quote is us humans you

5602
01:48:30,830 --> 01:48:30,840
think about that quote is us humans you
 

5603
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:32,690
think about that quote is us humans you
know with our sort of historical

5604
01:48:32,690 --> 01:48:32,700
know with our sort of historical
 

5605
01:48:32,700 --> 01:48:35,780
know with our sort of historical
development of you know our intellectual

5606
01:48:35,780 --> 01:48:35,790
development of you know our intellectual
 

5607
01:48:35,790 --> 01:48:38,720
development of you know our intellectual
history have explored this very small

5608
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:38,730
history have explored this very small
 

5609
01:48:38,730 --> 01:48:40,910
history have explored this very small
corner of what's possible in the

5610
01:48:40,910 --> 01:48:40,920
corner of what's possible in the
 

5611
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:42,920
corner of what's possible in the
computational universe and everything

5612
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:42,930
computational universe and everything
 

5613
01:48:42,930 --> 01:48:45,410
computational universe and everything
that we care about is contained in the

5614
01:48:45,410 --> 01:48:45,420
that we care about is contained in the
 

5615
01:48:45,420 --> 01:48:47,840
that we care about is contained in the
small corner and that means that you

5616
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:47,850
small corner and that means that you
 

5617
01:48:47,850 --> 01:48:50,780
small corner and that means that you
know you could say well gee you know I

5618
01:48:50,780 --> 01:48:50,790
know you could say well gee you know I
 

5619
01:48:50,790 --> 01:48:54,430
know you could say well gee you know I
want to you know what we what we end up

5620
01:48:54,430 --> 01:48:54,440
want to you know what we what we end up
 

5621
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:57,140
want to you know what we what we end up
wanting to talk about other things that

5622
01:48:57,140 --> 01:48:57,150
wanting to talk about other things that
 

5623
01:48:57,150 --> 01:48:58,130
wanting to talk about other things that
we as a society

5624
01:48:58,130 --> 01:48:58,140
we as a society
 

5625
01:48:58,140 --> 01:49:00,680
we as a society
have decided we care about and what

5626
01:49:00,680 --> 01:49:00,690
have decided we care about and what
 

5627
01:49:00,690 --> 01:49:02,150
have decided we care about and what
there's an interesting feedback loop I

5628
01:49:02,150 --> 01:49:02,160
there's an interesting feedback loop I
 

5629
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:05,480
there's an interesting feedback loop I
just mentioned mr. den but but um so you

5630
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:05,490
just mentioned mr. den but but um so you
 

5631
01:49:05,490 --> 01:49:08,570
just mentioned mr. den but but um so you
might say so here's a funny thing so

5632
01:49:08,570 --> 01:49:08,580
might say so here's a funny thing so
 

5633
01:49:08,580 --> 01:49:10,730
might say so here's a funny thing so
let's take language for example language

5634
01:49:10,730 --> 01:49:10,740
let's take language for example language
 

5635
01:49:10,740 --> 01:49:13,040
let's take language for example language
evolves we you say we we make up

5636
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:13,050
evolves we you say we we make up
 

5637
01:49:13,050 --> 01:49:14,690
evolves we you say we we make up
language to describe what we see in the

5638
01:49:14,690 --> 01:49:14,700
language to describe what we see in the
 

5639
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:16,790
language to describe what we see in the
world okay fine

5640
01:49:16,790 --> 01:49:16,800
world okay fine
 

5641
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:19,040
world okay fine
that's a fine idea imagine the you know

5642
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:19,050
that's a fine idea imagine the you know
 

5643
01:49:19,050 --> 01:49:21,170
that's a fine idea imagine the you know
in Paleolithic times people make up

5644
01:49:21,170 --> 01:49:21,180
in Paleolithic times people make up
 

5645
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:22,670
in Paleolithic times people make up
language they probably didn't have a

5646
01:49:22,670 --> 01:49:22,680
language they probably didn't have a
 

5647
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:24,620
language they probably didn't have a
word for table because they didn't have

5648
01:49:24,620 --> 01:49:24,630
word for table because they didn't have
 

5649
01:49:24,630 --> 01:49:27,290
word for table because they didn't have
any tables they probably had a word for

5650
01:49:27,290 --> 01:49:27,300
any tables they probably had a word for
 

5651
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:31,370
any tables they probably had a word for
rock but then we end up as a result of

5652
01:49:31,370 --> 01:49:31,380
rock but then we end up as a result of
 

5653
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:34,250
rock but then we end up as a result of
the particular you know development that

5654
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:34,260
the particular you know development that
 

5655
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:36,680
the particular you know development that
our civilization has gone through we

5656
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:36,690
our civilization has gone through we
 

5657
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:39,530
our civilization has gone through we
build tables and there was sort of a

5658
01:49:39,530 --> 01:49:39,540
build tables and there was sort of a
 

5659
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:41,720
build tables and there was sort of a
synergy between coming up with a word

5660
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:41,730
synergy between coming up with a word
 

5661
01:49:41,730 --> 01:49:44,060
synergy between coming up with a word
for table and deciding tables were a

5662
01:49:44,060 --> 01:49:44,070
for table and deciding tables were a
 

5663
01:49:44,070 --> 01:49:45,470
for table and deciding tables were a
thing and we should build a bunch of

5664
01:49:45,470 --> 01:49:45,480
thing and we should build a bunch of
 

5665
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:47,480
thing and we should build a bunch of
them and so there's a sort of

5666
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:47,490
them and so there's a sort of
 

5667
01:49:47,490 --> 01:49:49,670
them and so there's a sort of
complicated interplay between the things

5668
01:49:49,670 --> 01:49:49,680
complicated interplay between the things
 

5669
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:51,320
complicated interplay between the things
that we learn how to describe and how to

5670
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:51,330
that we learn how to describe and how to
 

5671
01:49:51,330 --> 01:49:53,480
that we learn how to describe and how to
think about the things that we build and

5672
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:53,490
think about the things that we build and
 

5673
01:49:53,490 --> 01:49:55,400
think about the things that we build and
put in our environment and then the

5674
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:55,410
put in our environment and then the
 

5675
01:49:55,410 --> 01:49:58,190
put in our environment and then the
things that we end up wanting to talk

5676
01:49:58,190 --> 01:49:58,200
things that we end up wanting to talk
 

5677
01:49:58,200 --> 01:49:59,930
things that we end up wanting to talk
about because they're things that we

5678
01:49:59,930 --> 01:49:59,940
about because they're things that we
 

5679
01:49:59,940 --> 01:50:01,520
about because they're things that we
have experience of in our environment

5680
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:01,530
have experience of in our environment
 

5681
01:50:01,530 --> 01:50:03,560
have experience of in our environment
and so that's the you know I think as we

5682
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:03,570
and so that's the you know I think as we
 

5683
01:50:03,570 --> 01:50:04,730
and so that's the you know I think as we
look at sort of the progress of

5684
01:50:04,730 --> 01:50:04,740
look at sort of the progress of
 

5685
01:50:04,740 --> 01:50:06,470
look at sort of the progress of
civilization there's you know there's

5686
01:50:06,470 --> 01:50:06,480
civilization there's you know there's
 

5687
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:09,830
civilization there's you know there's
various layers of first we you know we

5688
01:50:09,830 --> 01:50:09,840
various layers of first we you know we
 

5689
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:11,240
various layers of first we you know we
invent a thing that we can then think

5690
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:11,250
invent a thing that we can then think
 

5691
01:50:11,250 --> 01:50:14,570
invent a thing that we can then think
about and talk about then we build an

5692
01:50:14,570 --> 01:50:14,580
about and talk about then we build an
 

5693
01:50:14,580 --> 01:50:17,120
about and talk about then we build an
environment based on that then that

5694
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:17,130
environment based on that then that
 

5695
01:50:17,130 --> 01:50:19,220
environment based on that then that
allows us to do more stuff and we build

5696
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:19,230
allows us to do more stuff and we build
 

5697
01:50:19,230 --> 01:50:20,570
allows us to do more stuff and we build
on top of that and that's why for

5698
01:50:20,570 --> 01:50:20,580
on top of that and that's why for
 

5699
01:50:20,580 --> 01:50:21,950
on top of that and that's why for
example when we talk about computational

5700
01:50:21,950 --> 01:50:21,960
example when we talk about computational
 

5701
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:23,450
example when we talk about computational
thinking and teaching it to kids and so

5702
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:23,460
thinking and teaching it to kids and so
 

5703
01:50:23,460 --> 01:50:25,760
thinking and teaching it to kids and so
on that's one reason that's kind of

5704
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:25,770
on that's one reason that's kind of
 

5705
01:50:25,770 --> 01:50:27,440
on that's one reason that's kind of
important because we're building a layer

5706
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:27,450
important because we're building a layer
 

5707
01:50:27,450 --> 01:50:29,930
important because we're building a layer
of things that people are then familiar

5708
01:50:29,930 --> 01:50:29,940
of things that people are then familiar
 

5709
01:50:29,940 --> 01:50:31,580
of things that people are then familiar
with that's different from what we've

5710
01:50:31,580 --> 01:50:31,590
with that's different from what we've
 

5711
01:50:31,590 --> 01:50:33,410
with that's different from what we've
had so far and they give people a way to

5712
01:50:33,410 --> 01:50:33,420
had so far and they give people a way to
 

5713
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:34,610
had so far and they give people a way to
talk about things I give you one example

5714
01:50:34,610 --> 01:50:34,620
talk about things I give you one example
 

5715
01:50:34,620 --> 01:50:37,430
talk about things I give you one example
that um see that I have that still up

5716
01:50:37,430 --> 01:50:37,440
that um see that I have that still up
 

5717
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:47,360
that um see that I have that still up
the okay one one one example here from

5718
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:47,370
the okay one one one example here from
 

5719
01:50:47,370 --> 01:50:52,930
the okay one one one example here from
this blog post of mine actually so there

5720
01:50:52,930 --> 01:50:52,940
this blog post of mine actually so there
 

5721
01:50:52,940 --> 01:50:57,570
this blog post of mine actually so there
okay so that that thing there is a

5722
01:50:57,570 --> 01:50:57,580
okay so that that thing there is a
 

5723
01:50:57,580 --> 01:51:00,090
okay so that that thing there is a
nested pattern you know it's a bitter

5724
01:51:00,090 --> 01:51:00,100
nested pattern you know it's a bitter
 

5725
01:51:00,100 --> 01:51:06,720
nested pattern you know it's a bitter
sierpinski that that tile pattern was

5726
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:06,730
sierpinski that that tile pattern was
 

5727
01:51:06,730 --> 01:51:10,500
sierpinski that that tile pattern was
created in 1210 ad okay and it's the

5728
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:10,510
created in 1210 ad okay and it's the
 

5729
01:51:10,510 --> 01:51:11,910
created in 1210 ad okay and it's the
first example I know of a fractal

5730
01:51:11,910 --> 01:51:11,920
first example I know of a fractal
 

5731
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:13,590
first example I know of a fractal
pattern okay

5732
01:51:13,590 --> 01:51:13,600
pattern okay
 

5733
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:17,400
pattern okay
well the art historians wrote about

5734
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:17,410
well the art historians wrote about
 

5735
01:51:17,410 --> 01:51:19,290
well the art historians wrote about
these patterns they're a bunch of this

5736
01:51:19,290 --> 01:51:19,300
these patterns they're a bunch of this
 

5737
01:51:19,300 --> 01:51:20,850
these patterns they're a bunch of this
particular style of pattern they wrote

5738
01:51:20,850 --> 01:51:20,860
particular style of pattern they wrote
 

5739
01:51:20,860 --> 01:51:22,980
particular style of pattern they wrote
about these for years they never

5740
01:51:22,980 --> 01:51:22,990
about these for years they never
 

5741
01:51:22,990 --> 01:51:24,960
about these for years they never
discussed that nested pattern these

5742
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:24,970
discussed that nested pattern these
 

5743
01:51:24,970 --> 01:51:26,400
discussed that nested pattern these
patterns also have you know pictures of

5744
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:26,410
patterns also have you know pictures of
 

5745
01:51:26,410 --> 01:51:28,740
patterns also have you know pictures of
lions and then you know elephants and

5746
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:28,750
lions and then you know elephants and
 

5747
01:51:28,750 --> 01:51:30,120
lions and then you know elephants and
things like that on them they wrote

5748
01:51:30,120 --> 01:51:30,130
things like that on them they wrote
 

5749
01:51:30,130 --> 01:51:31,860
things like that on them they wrote
about those kinds of things but they

5750
01:51:31,860 --> 01:51:31,870
about those kinds of things but they
 

5751
01:51:31,870 --> 01:51:34,140
about those kinds of things but they
never mentioned the nested pattern until

5752
01:51:34,140 --> 01:51:34,150
never mentioned the nested pattern until
 

5753
01:51:34,150 --> 01:51:37,830
never mentioned the nested pattern until
basically about 25 years ago when

5754
01:51:37,830 --> 01:51:37,840
basically about 25 years ago when
 

5755
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:40,650
basically about 25 years ago when
fractals and so on became a thing and

5756
01:51:40,650 --> 01:51:40,660
fractals and so on became a thing and
 

5757
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:42,900
fractals and so on became a thing and
then it's ah I can now talk about that

5758
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:42,910
then it's ah I can now talk about that
 

5759
01:51:42,910 --> 01:51:44,700
then it's ah I can now talk about that
it's a nested pattern it's fractal and

5760
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:44,710
it's a nested pattern it's fractal and
 

5761
01:51:44,710 --> 01:51:47,310
it's a nested pattern it's fractal and
then you know before that time the art

5762
01:51:47,310 --> 01:51:47,320
then you know before that time the art
 

5763
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:49,530
then you know before that time the art
historians were blind to that particular

5764
01:51:49,530 --> 01:51:49,540
historians were blind to that particular
 

5765
01:51:49,540 --> 01:51:51,450
historians were blind to that particular
part of this pattern it's just like I

5766
01:51:51,450 --> 01:51:51,460
part of this pattern it's just like I
 

5767
01:51:51,460 --> 01:51:53,100
part of this pattern it's just like I
don't know what that is that there's no

5768
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:53,110
don't know what that is that there's no
 

5769
01:51:53,110 --> 01:51:54,300
don't know what that is that there's no
you know I don't have a word to describe

5770
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:54,310
you know I don't have a word to describe
 

5771
01:51:54,310 --> 01:51:58,320
you know I don't have a word to describe
it I'm not going to I'm not going to

5772
01:51:58,320 --> 01:51:58,330
it I'm not going to I'm not going to
 

5773
01:51:58,330 --> 01:51:59,520
it I'm not going to I'm not going to
talk about it so that's a you know it's

5774
01:51:59,520 --> 01:51:59,530
talk about it so that's a you know it's
 

5775
01:51:59,530 --> 01:52:01,890
talk about it so that's a you know it's
part of this feedback loop of things

5776
01:52:01,890 --> 01:52:01,900
part of this feedback loop of things
 

5777
01:52:01,900 --> 01:52:04,350
part of this feedback loop of things
that we we learn to describe then we

5778
01:52:04,350 --> 01:52:04,360
that we we learn to describe then we
 

5779
01:52:04,360 --> 01:52:05,970
that we we learn to describe then we
build in terms of those things then we

5780
01:52:05,970 --> 01:52:05,980
build in terms of those things then we
 

5781
01:52:05,980 --> 01:52:08,010
build in terms of those things then we
build another layer I think one of the

5782
01:52:08,010 --> 01:52:08,020
build another layer I think one of the
 

5783
01:52:08,020 --> 01:52:09,810
build another layer I think one of the
things I mean you talk about you know

5784
01:52:09,810 --> 01:52:09,820
things I mean you talk about you know
 

5785
01:52:09,820 --> 01:52:13,470
things I mean you talk about you know
just in the sort of the thing like one

5786
01:52:13,470 --> 01:52:13,480
just in the sort of the thing like one
 

5787
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:14,820
just in the sort of the thing like one
thing I'm really interested in is the

5788
01:52:14,820 --> 01:52:14,830
thing I'm really interested in is the
 

5789
01:52:14,830 --> 01:52:17,040
thing I'm really interested in is the
evolution of purposes so you know if you

5790
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:17,050
evolution of purposes so you know if you
 

5791
01:52:17,050 --> 01:52:19,590
evolution of purposes so you know if you
look back in human history there's a you

5792
01:52:19,590 --> 01:52:19,600
look back in human history there's a you
 

5793
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:21,720
look back in human history there's a you
know what was thought to be worth doing

5794
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:21,730
know what was thought to be worth doing
 

5795
01:52:21,730 --> 01:52:23,040
know what was thought to be worth doing
a thousand years ago it's different from

5796
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:23,050
a thousand years ago it's different from
 

5797
01:52:23,050 --> 01:52:24,630
a thousand years ago it's different from
what's thought to be worth doing today

5798
01:52:24,630 --> 01:52:24,640
what's thought to be worth doing today
 

5799
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:29,580
what's thought to be worth doing today
and part of that is is you know good

5800
01:52:29,580 --> 01:52:29,590
and part of that is is you know good
 

5801
01:52:29,590 --> 01:52:31,110
and part of that is is you know good
examples of things like you know walking

5802
01:52:31,110 --> 01:52:31,120
examples of things like you know walking
 

5803
01:52:31,120 --> 01:52:33,930
examples of things like you know walking
on a treadmill or buying goods in

5804
01:52:33,930 --> 01:52:33,940
on a treadmill or buying goods in
 

5805
01:52:33,940 --> 01:52:36,330
on a treadmill or buying goods in
virtual worlds both of these are hard to

5806
01:52:36,330 --> 01:52:36,340
virtual worlds both of these are hard to
 

5807
01:52:36,340 --> 01:52:37,830
virtual worlds both of these are hard to
explain to somebody from a thousand

5808
01:52:37,830 --> 01:52:37,840
explain to somebody from a thousand
 

5809
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:40,350
explain to somebody from a thousand
years ago because each one ends up being

5810
01:52:40,350 --> 01:52:40,360
years ago because each one ends up being
 

5811
01:52:40,360 --> 01:52:42,390
years ago because each one ends up being
a whole sort of societal story about

5812
01:52:42,390 --> 01:52:42,400
a whole sort of societal story about
 

5813
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:43,650
a whole sort of societal story about
we're doing this because we do that

5814
01:52:43,650 --> 01:52:43,660
we're doing this because we do that
 

5815
01:52:43,660 --> 01:52:45,480
we're doing this because we do that
because we do that and so the question

5816
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:45,490
because we do that and so the question
 

5817
01:52:45,490 --> 01:52:47,400
because we do that and so the question
is how will these purposes evolve in the

5818
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:47,410
is how will these purposes evolve in the
 

5819
01:52:47,410 --> 01:52:49,500
is how will these purposes evolve in the
future and I think one of the things

5820
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:49,510
future and I think one of the things
 

5821
01:52:49,510 --> 01:52:50,940
future and I think one of the things
that I view as a sort of sobering

5822
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:50,950
that I view as a sort of sobering
 

5823
01:52:50,950 --> 01:52:54,570
that I view as a sort of sobering
thought is that that term actually one

5824
01:52:54,570 --> 01:52:54,580
thought is that that term actually one
 

5825
01:52:54,580 --> 01:52:56,820
thought is that that term actually one
thing I found other disappointing and

5826
01:52:56,820 --> 01:52:56,830
thing I found other disappointing and
 

5827
01:52:56,830 --> 01:52:58,560
thing I found other disappointing and
then I became less pessimistic about it

5828
01:52:58,560 --> 01:52:58,570
then I became less pessimistic about it
 

5829
01:52:58,570 --> 01:53:00,150
then I became less pessimistic about it
is if you think about the future of the

5830
01:53:00,150 --> 01:53:00,160
is if you think about the future of the
 

5831
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:01,980
is if you think about the future of the
human condition and you know we've been

5832
01:53:01,980 --> 01:53:01,990
human condition and you know we've been
 

5833
01:53:01,990 --> 01:53:04,320
human condition and you know we've been
successful in making our AI systems and

5834
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:04,330
successful in making our AI systems and
 

5835
01:53:04,330 --> 01:53:06,450
successful in making our AI systems and
we can read out brains and we can upload

5836
01:53:06,450 --> 01:53:06,460
we can read out brains and we can upload
 

5837
01:53:06,460 --> 01:53:08,070
we can read out brains and we can upload
consciousnesses and things like that and

5838
01:53:08,070 --> 01:53:08,080
consciousnesses and things like that and
 

5839
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:09,780
consciousnesses and things like that and
we've eventually got this box with

5840
01:53:09,780 --> 01:53:09,790
we've eventually got this box with
 

5841
01:53:09,790 --> 01:53:11,189
we've eventually got this box with
trillions of souls and

5842
01:53:11,189 --> 01:53:11,199
trillions of souls and
 

5843
01:53:11,199 --> 01:53:12,779
trillions of souls and
and the question is what are these souls

5844
01:53:12,779 --> 01:53:12,789
and the question is what are these souls
 

5845
01:53:12,789 --> 01:53:16,529
and the question is what are these souls
doing and to us today it looks like

5846
01:53:16,529 --> 01:53:16,539
doing and to us today it looks like
 

5847
01:53:16,539 --> 01:53:18,000
doing and to us today it looks like
they're playing video games to the rest

5848
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:18,010
they're playing video games to the rest
 

5849
01:53:18,010 --> 01:53:20,250
they're playing video games to the rest
of eternity right and that seems like a

5850
01:53:20,250 --> 01:53:20,260
of eternity right and that seems like a
 

5851
01:53:20,260 --> 01:53:22,169
of eternity right and that seems like a
kind of a bad outcome it's like we've

5852
01:53:22,169 --> 01:53:22,179
kind of a bad outcome it's like we've
 

5853
01:53:22,179 --> 01:53:23,639
kind of a bad outcome it's like we've
gone through all of this long history

5854
01:53:23,639 --> 01:53:23,649
gone through all of this long history
 

5855
01:53:23,649 --> 01:53:25,649
gone through all of this long history
and what do we end up with we end up

5856
01:53:25,649 --> 01:53:25,659
and what do we end up with we end up
 

5857
01:53:25,659 --> 01:53:27,689
and what do we end up with we end up
with a trillion souls in a box playing

5858
01:53:27,689 --> 01:53:27,699
with a trillion souls in a box playing
 

5859
01:53:27,699 --> 01:53:31,139
with a trillion souls in a box playing
video games okay um and I thought this

5860
01:53:31,139 --> 01:53:31,149
video games okay um and I thought this
 

5861
01:53:31,149 --> 01:53:33,449
video games okay um and I thought this
is a very you know depressing outcome so

5862
01:53:33,449 --> 01:53:33,459
is a very you know depressing outcome so
 

5863
01:53:33,459 --> 01:53:35,850
is a very you know depressing outcome so
to speak and then I realized that that

5864
01:53:35,850 --> 01:53:35,860
to speak and then I realized that that
 

5865
01:53:35,860 --> 01:53:38,129
to speak and then I realized that that
actually you know if you look at the

5866
01:53:38,129 --> 01:53:38,139
actually you know if you look at the
 

5867
01:53:38,139 --> 01:53:40,399
actually you know if you look at the
sort of arc of human history people

5868
01:53:40,399 --> 01:53:40,409
sort of arc of human history people
 

5869
01:53:40,409 --> 01:53:42,839
sort of arc of human history people
aren't any given time in history people

5870
01:53:42,839 --> 01:53:42,849
aren't any given time in history people
 

5871
01:53:42,849 --> 01:53:49,199
aren't any given time in history people
have been you know they've my main

5872
01:53:49,199 --> 01:53:49,209
have been you know they've my main
 

5873
01:53:49,209 --> 01:53:51,239
have been you know they've my main
conclusion is that any time in history

5874
01:53:51,239 --> 01:53:51,249
conclusion is that any time in history
 

5875
01:53:51,249 --> 01:53:54,060
conclusion is that any time in history
the things people do seem meaningful and

5876
01:53:54,060 --> 01:53:54,070
the things people do seem meaningful and
 

5877
01:53:54,070 --> 01:53:55,709
the things people do seem meaningful and
purposeful to them at that time in

5878
01:53:55,709 --> 01:53:55,719
purposeful to them at that time in
 

5879
01:53:55,719 --> 01:53:59,310
purposeful to them at that time in
history and history moves on and you

5880
01:53:59,310 --> 01:53:59,320
history and history moves on and you
 

5881
01:53:59,320 --> 01:54:01,080
history and history moves on and you
know like a thousand years ago there

5882
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:01,090
know like a thousand years ago there
 

5883
01:54:01,090 --> 01:54:03,750
know like a thousand years ago there
were a lot of purposes that people had

5884
01:54:03,750 --> 01:54:03,760
were a lot of purposes that people had
 

5885
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:06,149
were a lot of purposes that people had
that you know what to do with weird

5886
01:54:06,149 --> 01:54:06,159
that you know what to do with weird
 

5887
01:54:06,159 --> 01:54:08,129
that you know what to do with weird
superstitions and things like that that

5888
01:54:08,129 --> 01:54:08,139
superstitions and things like that that
 

5889
01:54:08,139 --> 01:54:09,959
superstitions and things like that that
we say why the heck are you doing that

5890
01:54:09,959 --> 01:54:09,969
we say why the heck are you doing that
 

5891
01:54:09,969 --> 01:54:11,729
we say why the heck are you doing that
that just doesn't make any sense

5892
01:54:11,729 --> 01:54:11,739
that just doesn't make any sense
 

5893
01:54:11,739 --> 01:54:14,279
that just doesn't make any sense
right but to them at that time it made

5894
01:54:14,279 --> 01:54:14,289
right but to them at that time it made
 

5895
01:54:14,289 --> 01:54:16,229
right but to them at that time it made
all the sense in the world and I think

5896
01:54:16,229 --> 01:54:16,239
all the sense in the world and I think
 

5897
01:54:16,239 --> 01:54:17,639
all the sense in the world and I think
that you know the thing that makes me

5898
01:54:17,639 --> 01:54:17,649
that you know the thing that makes me
 

5899
01:54:17,649 --> 01:54:19,439
that you know the thing that makes me
sort of less depressed about the future

5900
01:54:19,439 --> 01:54:19,449
sort of less depressed about the future
 

5901
01:54:19,449 --> 01:54:21,929
sort of less depressed about the future
so to speak is that at any given time in

5902
01:54:21,929 --> 01:54:21,939
so to speak is that at any given time in
 

5903
01:54:21,939 --> 01:54:24,540
so to speak is that at any given time in
history you know you can still have

5904
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:24,550
history you know you can still have
 

5905
01:54:24,550 --> 01:54:27,120
history you know you can still have
meaningful purposes even though they may

5906
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:27,130
meaningful purposes even though they may
 

5907
01:54:27,130 --> 01:54:28,469
meaningful purposes even though they may
not look meaningful from a different

5908
01:54:28,469 --> 01:54:28,479
not look meaningful from a different
 

5909
01:54:28,479 --> 01:54:29,969
not look meaningful from a different
point in history and that there's sort

5910
01:54:29,969 --> 01:54:29,979
point in history and that there's sort
 

5911
01:54:29,979 --> 01:54:31,319
point in history and that there's sort
of a whole theory you can kind of build

5912
01:54:31,319 --> 01:54:31,329
of a whole theory you can kind of build
 

5913
01:54:31,329 --> 01:54:33,810
of a whole theory you can kind of build
up based on kind of the the trajectories

5914
01:54:33,810 --> 01:54:33,820
up based on kind of the the trajectories
 

5915
01:54:33,820 --> 01:54:35,459
up based on kind of the the trajectories
that you've followed through the space

5916
01:54:35,459 --> 01:54:35,469
that you've followed through the space
 

5917
01:54:35,469 --> 01:54:37,379
that you've followed through the space
of purposes and sort of interesting if

5918
01:54:37,379 --> 01:54:37,389
of purposes and sort of interesting if
 

5919
01:54:37,389 --> 01:54:39,839
of purposes and sort of interesting if
you can't jump like you say let's get

5920
01:54:39,839 --> 01:54:39,849
you can't jump like you say let's get
 

5921
01:54:39,849 --> 01:54:42,449
you can't jump like you say let's get
chronically frozen for a you know 300

5922
01:54:42,449 --> 01:54:42,459
chronically frozen for a you know 300
 

5923
01:54:42,459 --> 01:54:45,419
chronically frozen for a you know 300
years and then you know be be back again

5924
01:54:45,419 --> 01:54:45,429
years and then you know be be back again
 

5925
01:54:45,429 --> 01:54:48,509
years and then you know be be back again
the the interesting cases then you know

5926
01:54:48,509 --> 01:54:48,519
the the interesting cases then you know
 

5927
01:54:48,519 --> 01:54:51,929
the the interesting cases then you know
are the purposes that you sort of you

5928
01:54:51,929 --> 01:54:51,939
are the purposes that you sort of you
 

5929
01:54:51,939 --> 01:54:54,389
are the purposes that you sort of you
know that you find yourself in ones that

5930
01:54:54,389 --> 01:54:54,399
know that you find yourself in ones that
 

5931
01:54:54,399 --> 01:54:56,009
know that you find yourself in ones that
have any continuity with what we know

5932
01:54:56,009 --> 01:54:56,019
have any continuity with what we know
 

5933
01:54:56,019 --> 01:54:56,520
have any continuity with what we know
today

5934
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:56,530
today
 

5935
01:54:56,530 --> 01:54:57,870
today
I should stop with that that's a

5936
01:54:57,870 --> 01:54:57,880
I should stop with that that's a
 

5937
01:54:57,880 --> 01:55:00,310
I should stop with that that's a
beautiful way to end it

5938
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:00,320
beautiful way to end it
 

5939
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:02,810
beautiful way to end it
they Han

5940
01:55:02,810 --> 01:55:02,820

 

5941
01:55:02,820 --> 01:55:05,490
