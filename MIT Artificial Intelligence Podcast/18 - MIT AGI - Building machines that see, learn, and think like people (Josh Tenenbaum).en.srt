jointly now it's really exciting time to
 

105
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,760
jointly now it's really exciting time to
be doing anything related to

106
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:58,770
be doing anything related to
 

107
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,069
be doing anything related to
intelligence or certainly to AI for all

the reasons that you know brought you

the reasons that you know brought you
 

111
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,859
the reasons that you know brought you
all here I don't have to tell you this

112
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:03,869
all here I don't have to tell you this
 

113
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,050
all here I don't have to tell you this
we have all these ways in which AI is

114
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:06,060
we have all these ways in which AI is
 

115
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,270
we have all these ways in which AI is
kind of finally here we finally live in

116
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:08,280
kind of finally here we finally live in
 

117
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,160
kind of finally here we finally live in
the era of something like real practical

118
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,170
the era of something like real practical
 

119
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,770
the era of something like real practical
AI

120
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:11,780
AI
 

121
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,510
AI
or for those who've been around for a

122
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:13,520
or for those who've been around for a
 

123
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,370
or for those who've been around for a
while and have seen some of the rises

124
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:15,380
while and have seen some of the rises
 

125
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,110
while and have seen some of the rises
and falls you know AI is back in a big

126
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
and falls you know AI is back in a big
 

127
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,510
and falls you know AI is back in a big
way but from my perspective and I think

128
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520
way but from my perspective and I think
 

129
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,370
way but from my perspective and I think
maybe this reflects you know why we

130
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:21,380
maybe this reflects you know why we
 

131
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,170
maybe this reflects you know why we
distinguish what we might call a GI from

132
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:23,180
distinguish what we might call a GI from
 

133
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,660
distinguish what we might call a GI from
AI we we don't really have any real AI

134
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:25,670
AI we we don't really have any real AI
 

135
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,820
AI we we don't really have any real AI
basically we have what I like to call AI

136
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:27,830
basically we have what I like to call AI
 

137
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,370
basically we have what I like to call AI
technologies which are systems that do

technologies which are systems that do
things we used to think that only humans

140
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:32,300
things we used to think that only humans
 

141
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,180
things we used to think that only humans
could do and now we have machines that

142
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,190
could do and now we have machines that
 

143
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,250
could do and now we have machines that
do them often quite well maybe even

144
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:36,260
do them often quite well maybe even
 

145
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,380
do them often quite well maybe even
better than any human who's ever lived

146
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:38,390
better than any human who's ever lived
 

147
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,230
better than any human who's ever lived
right like a machine that plays go but

148
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:41,240
right like a machine that plays go but
 

149
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,240
right like a machine that plays go but
none of these systems I would say are

none of these systems I would say are

00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,650
none of these systems I would say are
truly intelligent none of them have

00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:12,380
match or even tell you that go it what
 

179
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,230

00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:14,240
go is it can't even tell you the go is a
 

181
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,370
go is it can't even tell you the go is a
game because it doesn't even know what a

it's a little bit down the line for us

200
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:35,570
it's a little bit down the line for us
 

201
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,259
it's a little bit down the line for us
here in Massachusetts but you know she

202
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:38,269
here in Massachusetts but you know she
 

203
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:39,490
here in Massachusetts but you know she
didn't have to be specially engineered

204
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:39,500
didn't have to be specially engineered
 

205
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,759

by billion dollar startups and you know

206
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:42,769
by billion dollar startups and you know
 

207
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:44,380

she got really into chess recently and

208
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:44,390
she got really into chess recently and
 

209
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,970
she got really into chess recently and
now she's taught herself chess by

210
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:45,980
now she's taught herself chess by
 

211
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,890
now she's taught herself chess by
playing just you know a handful of games

212
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:47,900
playing just you know a handful of games
 

213
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,840
playing just you know a handful of games
basically I mean she can do any one of

214
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:49,850
basically I mean she can do any one of
 

215
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,310
basically I mean she can do any one of
these activities and any one of us can

00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:51,320
these activities and any one of us can
 

217
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,170
these activities and any one of us can
so what is it what's that what makes up

218
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:53,180
so what is it what's that what makes up
 

219
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,509
so what is it what's that what makes up
the difference well there's many things

220
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:55,519
the difference well there's many things
 

221
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,080
the difference well there's many things
right I'll talk about the the focus for

right I'll talk about the the focus for
 

223
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,120
right I'll talk about the the focus for
us and our research and a lot of us

on pattern recognition and maybe even
 

269
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,640
on pattern recognition and maybe even
you know has coming close to solving the

meaning what really is a meaning and how

642
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:52,589
meaning what really is a meaning and how
 

643
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:54,710
meaning what really is a meaning and how
does a child grasp it or how did

644
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:54,720
does a child grasp it or how did
 

645
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,059
does a child grasp it or how did
children actually learn what do babies

646
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:56,069
children actually learn what do babies
 

647
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:57,739
children actually learn what do babies
brains actually start with are they

648
00:10:57,739 --> 00:10:57,749
brains actually start with are they
 

649
00:10:57,749 --> 00:10:59,179
brains actually start with are they
blank slates or do they start with some

650
00:10:59,179 --> 00:10:59,189
blank slates or do they start with some
 

651
00:10:59,189 --> 00:11:00,710
blank slates or do they start with some
kind of cognitive structure and then

652
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:00,720
kind of cognitive structure and then
 

653
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,929
kind of cognitive structure and then
what is real learning look like these

654
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:02,939
what is real learning look like these
 

655
00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:04,189
what is real learning look like these
are just some of the questions that were

00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,330
we're interested in working on
or when we talked about culture we mean

660
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:07,340
or when we talked about culture we mean
 

661
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,190
or when we talked about culture we mean
how do you learn all the things you

662
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,200
how do you learn all the things you
 

663
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,500
how do you learn all the things you
didn't directly experience right but

664
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:11,510
didn't directly experience right but
 

665
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,550
didn't directly experience right but
that somehow you got from the

00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:12,560
that somehow you got from the
 

667
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,750
that somehow you got from the
accumulation of knowledge in society

accumulation of knowledge in society
 

669
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,330
accumulation of knowledge in society
over many generations or how do you ever

00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:16,340
over many generations or how do you ever
 

671
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,520
over many generations or how do you ever
think of new ideas or answers to new

672
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:18,530
think of new ideas or answers to new
 

673
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,660

talk about how we model the world where
 

683
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,150

on the beginnings of these problems in
 

709
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,090
on the beginnings of these problems in
the near term this is the long term like

710
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:52,100
the near term this is the long term like
 

711
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,460
the near term this is the long term like
think 50 years okay maybe short or maybe

712
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:54,470
think 50 years okay maybe short or maybe
 

713
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,810
think 50 years okay maybe short or maybe
longer I don't know but think well

714
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:55,820
longer I don't know but think well
 

715
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,920
longer I don't know but think well
beyond well beyond 10 years but in the

716
00:11:59,920 --> 00:11:59,930
beyond well beyond 10 years but in the
 

717
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,720
beyond well beyond 10 years but in the
short term 5 to 10 years a lot of our

718
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:01,730
short term 5 to 10 years a lot of our
 

719
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,670
short term 5 to 10 years a lot of our
focus is around visual intelligence and

720
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680
focus is around visual intelligence and
 

721
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,020
focus is around visual intelligence and
there's many reasons for that again we

722
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,030
there's many reasons for that again we
 

723
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,060
there's many reasons for that again we
can build on the successes of deep

724
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,070
can build on the successes of deep
 

725
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,320
can build on the successes of deep
networks and a lot of pattern

726
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:08,330
networks and a lot of pattern
 

727
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,060
networks and a lot of pattern
recognition and machine vision it's a

728
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:10,070
recognition and machine vision it's a
 

729
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,320
recognition and machine vision it's a
good way to put these ideas into

730
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,330
good way to put these ideas into
 

731
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,670
good way to put these ideas into
practice when we when we look at the

732
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:12,680
practice when we when we look at the
 

733
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,130
practice when we when we look at the
actual brain the visual system in the

734
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:15,140
actual brain the visual system in the
 

735
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,590
actual brain the visual system in the
brain in the human and other mammalian

736
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,600
brain in the human and other mammalian
 

737
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,330
brain in the human and other mammalian
brains for example is really very

738
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:19,340
brains for example is really very
 

739
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,830
brains for example is really very
clearly the best understood part of the

clearly the best understood part of the
 

741
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,510
clearly the best understood part of the
brain and at a circuit level it's the

742
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:22,520
brain and at a circuit level it's the
 

743
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,610
brain and at a circuit level it's the
part of the brain that's most inspired

744
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:24,620
part of the brain that's most inspired

current deep learning and neural network
 

747
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,320

systems but even there there's things

748
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:29,330
systems but even there there's things
 

749
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,000
systems but even there there's things
which we still don't really understand

750
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,010
which we still don't really understand
 

751
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,490
which we still don't really understand
like engineers so here's an example of a

752
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:33,500
like engineers so here's an example of a
 

753
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,080
like engineers so here's an example of a
basic problem in visual intelligence

754
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,090
basic problem in visual intelligence
 

755
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,780
basic problem in visual intelligence
that we and others in the centre are

756
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:37,790
that we and others in the centre are
 

757
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,460

trying to solve look around you and you

758
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:41,470
trying to solve look around you and you
 

759
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,020
trying to solve look around you and you
feel like there's a whole world around

760
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,030
feel like there's a whole world around
 

761
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,070
feel like there's a whole world around
you and there is a whole world around

762
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:45,080
you and there is a whole world around
 

763
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,560
you and there is a whole world around
you feel like your brain captures it but

764
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:47,570
you feel like your brain captures it but
 

765
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,360
you feel like your brain captures it but
what what the actual sense data that's

766
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:49,370
what what the actual sense data that's
 

767
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,370
what what the actual sense data that's
coming in through your eyes looks more

768
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:51,380
coming in through your eyes looks more
 

769
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,810
coming in through your eyes looks more
like this photograph here where you can

770
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:52,820
like this photograph here where you can
 

771
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,100
like this photograph here where you can
see there's a crowd scene but it's

772
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,110
see there's a crowd scene but it's
 

773
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,020
see there's a crowd scene but it's
mostly blurry except for a small region

774
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,030
mostly blurry except for a small region
 

775
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,150
mostly blurry except for a small region
of high resolution in the center so that

776
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,160
of high resolution in the center so that
 

777
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,100
of high resolution in the center so that
corresponds biologically to what part of

778
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,110
corresponds biologically to what part of
 

779
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,690
corresponds biologically to what part of
the images in your fovea that's the

780
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:01,700
the images in your fovea that's the
 

781
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,490
the images in your fovea that's the
central region of cells in the retina

782
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:03,500
central region of cells in the retina
 

783
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,010
central region of cells in the retina
where you have really high-resolution

784
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:05,020
where you have really high-resolution
 

785
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,050
where you have really high-resolution
visual data the size of your phobia is

786
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:08,060
visual data the size of your phobia is
 

787
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,490
visual data the size of your phobia is
roughly like if you hold out your thumb

788
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:09,500
roughly like if you hold out your thumb
 

789
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,140
roughly like if you hold out your thumb
at arm's length it's a little bit bigger

790
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:11,150
at arm's length it's a little bit bigger
 

791
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,910
at arm's length it's a little bit bigger
than that but not much bigger right

792
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:12,920
than that but not much bigger right
 

793
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,760
than that but not much bigger right
most of the image in terms of the actual

797
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,030
information coming in and a bottom-up
sense to your brain is really quite

798
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,040

799
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,680
sense to your brain is really quite
blurry

800
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:19,690
blurry
 

801
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,290
blurry
but somehow by looking at just one part

802
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:22,300
but somehow by looking at just one part
 

803
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,240
but somehow by looking at just one part
and then by secada around or making a

804
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,250
and then by secada around or making a
 

805
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,100
and then by secada around or making a
few eye movements you get a few glimpses

806
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,110
few eye movements you get a few glimpses
 

807
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,020
few eye movements you get a few glimpses
each not much bigger than the size of

808
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,030
each not much bigger than the size of
 

809
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,160
each not much bigger than the size of
your thumb at arm's length

810
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:29,170
your thumb at arm's length
 

811
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,840
your thumb at arm's length
somehow you stitch that information

812
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:30,850
somehow you stitch that information
 

813
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,490
somehow you stitch that information
together into what feels like and really

814
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:32,500
together into what feels like and really
 

815
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,740
together into what feels like and really
is a rich representation of the whole

816
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:34,750
is a rich representation of the whole
 

817
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,780
is a rich representation of the whole
world around you and when I say around

818
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:36,790
world around you and when I say around
 

819
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,610
world around you and when I say around
you I mean literally around you so

820
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:38,620
you I mean literally around you so
 

821
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,030
you I mean literally around you so
here's another kind of demonstration um

822
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,040
here's another kind of demonstration um
 

823
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,230
here's another kind of demonstration um
without turning around nobody's allowed

824
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:43,240
without turning around nobody's allowed
 

825
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,300
without turning around nobody's allowed
to turn around ask yourself what's

826
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:45,310
to turn around ask yourself what's
 

827
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,370
to turn around ask yourself what's
behind you now the answer is going to be

828
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:47,380
behind you now the answer is going to be
 

829
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,900
behind you now the answer is going to be
different for different people depending

830
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:48,910
different for different people depending
 

831
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,610
different for different people depending
on where you're sitting right for most

832
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:50,620
on where you're sitting right for most
 

833
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,650
on where you're sitting right for most
of you you might think well there's I

834
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:52,660
of you you might think well there's I
 

835
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,000
of you you might think well there's I
think there's a person pretty close

836
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,010
think there's a person pretty close
 

837
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,800
think there's a person pretty close
behind me all right you know you're in a

838
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:55,810
behind me all right you know you're in a
 

839
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,030
behind me all right you know you're in a
crowded auditorium although you haven't

840
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
crowded auditorium although you haven't
 

841
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,350
crowded auditorium although you haven't
seen that person you know that they're

842
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:58,360
seen that person you know that they're
 

843
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,950
seen that person you know that they're
there right for people in the very back

844
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:01,960
there right for people in the very back
 

845
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,390
there right for people in the very back
row you know there isn't a person behind

846
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:03,400
row you know there isn't a person behind
 

847
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,500
row you know there isn't a person behind
you and you're conscious of being in the

848
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:04,510
you and you're conscious of being in the
 

849
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,360
you and you're conscious of being in the
back row right you might be conscious

850
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:06,370
back row right you might be conscious
 

851
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,860
back row right you might be conscious
that there's a wall right behind you but

852
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:07,870
that there's a wall right behind you but
 

853
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,870
that there's a wall right behind you but
now for the people who are in the room

854
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:09,880
now for the people who are in the room
 

855
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,510
now for the people who are in the room
not in the very back think about how far

856
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:12,520
not in the very back think about how far
 

857
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,130
not in the very back think about how far
behind you is the back like where's the

858
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:14,140
behind you is the back like where's the
 

859
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,110
behind you is the back like where's the
nearest wall behind you so we can get

860
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:16,120
nearest wall behind you so we can get
 

861
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,970
nearest wall behind you so we can get
maybe we can call out try a little

862
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:17,980
maybe we can call out try a little
 

863
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,020
maybe we can call out try a little
demonstration so I don't know I'm

864
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,030
demonstration so I don't know I'm
 

865
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,520
demonstration so I don't know I'm
pointing to someone there can you see

866
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:20,530
pointing to someone there can you see
 

867
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,380
pointing to someone there can you see
phrase say something if you think I'm

868
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:22,390
phrase say something if you think I'm
 

869
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:25,320
phrase say something if you think I'm
pointing at you well I could have been

870
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:25,330
pointing at you well I could have been
 

871
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,520
pointing at you well I could have been
pointing at you but I'm pointing someone

872
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:26,530
pointing at you but I'm pointing someone
 

873
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,960
pointing at you but I'm pointing someone
behind you okay I'll point to you yeah

874
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:27,970
behind you okay I'll point to you yeah
 

875
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,250
behind you okay I'll point to you yeah
I'm pointing to you all right

876
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:29,260
I'm pointing to you all right
 

877
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,320
I'm pointing to you all right
so how far is the nearest wall no you

878
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:31,330
so how far is the nearest wall no you
 

879
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,730
so how far is the nearest wall no you
can't turn around you've blown your

880
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:32,740
can't turn around you've blown your
 

881
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,190
can't turn around you've blown your
chance right without turning around okay

882
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:35,200
chance right without turning around okay
 

883
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,050
chance right without turning around okay
so you you were laughs okay do you see

884
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:37,060
so you you were laughs okay do you see
 

885
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,310
so you you were laughs okay do you see
I'm pointing to you there with the tie

886
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,320
I'm pointing to you there with the tie
 

887
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,800
I'm pointing to you there with the tie
okay so without turning around how far

888
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:40,810
okay so without turning around how far
 

889
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:46,470
okay so without turning around how far
is the nearest wall behind you that's

890
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,480
is the nearest wall behind you that's
 

891
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,950
is the nearest wall behind you that's
sorry how far five meters okay well I

892
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:49,960
sorry how far five meters okay well I
 

893
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,350
sorry how far five meters okay well I
mean that might be about right no other

894
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:52,360
mean that might be about right no other
 

895
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,740
mean that might be about right no other
people can turn around how about you how

896
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:55,750
people can turn around how about you how
 

897
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,580
people can turn around how about you how
far is the nearest wall behind you

898
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:58,590
far is the nearest wall behind you
 

899
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:02,430
far is the nearest wall behind you
ten meters okay that might be right yeah

900
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:02,440
ten meters okay that might be right yeah
 

901
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,620
ten meters okay that might be right yeah
how about here

902
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:04,630
how about here
 

903
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:08,250
how about here
how what do you think twenty okay see

904
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:08,260
how what do you think twenty okay see
 

905
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,150
how what do you think twenty okay see
yeah since I didn't grow up in the

906
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:09,160
yeah since I didn't grow up in the
 

907
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,829
yeah since I didn't grow up in the
metric system I barely know but yeah I

908
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:10,839
metric system I barely know but yeah I
 

909
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,140
metric system I barely know but yeah I
mean I mean the point is that like

910
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,150
mean I mean the point is that like
 

911
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:16,470
mean I mean the point is that like
you're you're you each of you is is not

912
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,480
you're you're you each of you is is not
 

913
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,210
you're you're you each of you is is not
surely not exactly right but you're

914
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:18,220
surely not exactly right but you're
 

915
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,410
surely not exactly right but you're
certainly within an order of magnitude

916
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:19,420
certainly within an order of magnitude
 

917
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,060
certainly within an order of magnitude
and I guess if we actually tried to

918
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:21,070
and I guess if we actually tried to
 

919
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,829
and I guess if we actually tried to
measure you know you're probably my

920
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:22,839
measure you know you're probably my
 

921
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,510
measure you know you're probably my
guess is you're probably right within

922
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:24,520
guess is you're probably right within
 

923
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,520
guess is you're probably right within
you know fifty percent or less often you

924
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:26,530
you know fifty percent or less often you
 

925
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,780
you know fifty percent or less often you
know maybe just twenty percent error

926
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:27,790
know maybe just twenty percent error
 

927
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,240
know maybe just twenty percent error
okay so how do you know this I mean even

928
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:30,250
okay so how do you know this I mean even
 

929
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,650
okay so how do you know this I mean even
if it's not what did you say twenty

930
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:31,660
if it's not what did you say twenty
 

931
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,540
if it's not what did you say twenty
meters even if it's not twenty meters

932
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:33,550
meters even if it's not twenty meters
 

933
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,250
meters even if it's not twenty meters
it's probably closer to 20 meters than

934
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:35,260
it's probably closer to 20 meters than
 

935
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,199
it's probably closer to 20 meters than
it is to 5 or 10 meters and then it is

936
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:37,209
it is to 5 or 10 meters and then it is
 

937
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:39,150
it is to 5 or 10 meters and then it is
250 meters so how do you know this you

938
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:39,160
250 meters so how do you know this you
 

939
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,470
250 meters so how do you know this you
haven't turned around in a while right

940
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:40,480
haven't turned around in a while right
 

941
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,990
haven't turned around in a while right
but some part of your brain is tracking

942
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:43,000
but some part of your brain is tracking
 

943
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,870
but some part of your brain is tracking
the whole world around you right and how

944
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:45,880
the whole world around you right and how
 

945
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,530
the whole world around you right and how
many people are behind you yeah like a

946
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:49,540
many people are behind you yeah like a
 

947
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,670
many people are behind you yeah like a
few hundred right I mean I don't know if

948
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:50,680
few hundred right I mean I don't know if
 

949
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,740
few hundred right I mean I don't know if
it's 200 or 300 or but it's not a

950
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:52,750
it's 200 or 300 or but it's not a
 

951
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,560
it's 200 or 300 or but it's not a
thousand I mean I don't think so and

952
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:55,570
thousand I mean I don't think so and
 

953
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,319
thousand I mean I don't think so and
it's certainly not ten or 20 or 50 right

954
00:15:58,319 --> 00:15:58,329
it's certainly not ten or 20 or 50 right
 

955
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:00,509
it's certainly not ten or 20 or 50 right
so you track these things and you use

956
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:00,519
so you track these things and you use
 

957
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:01,829
so you track these things and you use
them to plan your actions

958
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:01,839
them to plan your actions
 

959
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,829
them to plan your actions
okay so again think about how instantly

960
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:04,839
okay so again think about how instantly
 

961
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,800
okay so again think about how instantly
effortlessly and very reliably okay your

962
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:07,810
effortlessly and very reliably okay your
 

963
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,480
effortlessly and very reliably okay your
brain computes all these things so the

964
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:09,490
brain computes all these things so the
 

965
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,759
brain computes all these things so the
people and objects around you and it's

966
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:11,769
people and objects around you and it's
 

967
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:13,319
people and objects around you and it's
not just you know approximations

968
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:13,329
not just you know approximations
 

969
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:14,790
not just you know approximations
certainly when we're talking about

970
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:14,800
certainly when we're talking about
 

971
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,350
certainly when we're talking about
what's what's behind you in space

972
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:16,360
what's what's behind you in space
 

973
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,630
what's what's behind you in space
there's a lot of imprecision but when it

974
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:18,640
there's a lot of imprecision but when it
 

975
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,889
there's a lot of imprecision but when it
comes to reaching for things right in

976
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:19,899
comes to reaching for things right in
 

977
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:20,430
comes to reaching for things right in
front of you

978
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:20,440
front of you
 

979
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,889
front of you
very precise shape and physical property

980
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:22,899
very precise shape and physical property
 

981
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,120
very precise shape and physical property
estimates needed to pick up and

982
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,130
estimates needed to pick up and
 

983
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,800
estimates needed to pick up and
manipulate objects and then when it

984
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:25,810
manipulate objects and then when it
 

985
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,480
manipulate objects and then when it
comes to people it's not just the

986
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:27,490
comes to people it's not just the
 

987
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,889
comes to people it's not just the
existence of the people but something

988
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:28,899
existence of the people but something
 

989
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:30,240
existence of the people but something
about what's in their head right you

990
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,250
about what's in their head right you
 

991
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,829
about what's in their head right you
track whether someone's paying attention

992
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:31,839
track whether someone's paying attention
 

993
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,300
track whether someone's paying attention
to you and you're talking to them what

994
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:33,310
to you and you're talking to them what
 

995
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,650
to you and you're talking to them what
they might want from you what they might

996
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:34,660
they might want from you what they might
 

997
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,150
they might want from you what they might
be thinking about you what they might be

998
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
be thinking about you what they might be
 

999
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,550
be thinking about you what they might be
thinking about other people okay so when

1000
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:38,560
thinking about other people okay so when
 

1001
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,380
thinking about other people okay so when
we talk about visual intelligence this

1002
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:40,390
we talk about visual intelligence this
 

1003
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,819
we talk about visual intelligence this
is the whole stuff we're talking about

1004
00:16:41,819 --> 00:16:41,829
is the whole stuff we're talking about
 

1005
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:43,829
is the whole stuff we're talking about
and you can start to see how it turns

1006
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:43,839
and you can start to see how it turns
 

1007
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,139
and you can start to see how it turns
into basic questions I think of not of

1008
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:46,149
into basic questions I think of not of
 

1009
00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:48,300
into basic questions I think of not of
what we might call the beginnings of

1010
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:48,310
what we might call the beginnings of
 

1011
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,130
what we might call the beginnings of
consciousness at least our awareness of

1012
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:50,140
consciousness at least our awareness of
 

1013
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:53,790
consciousness at least our awareness of
ourself in the world and of ourselves as

1014
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:53,800
ourself in the world and of ourselves as
 

1015
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,829
ourself in the world and of ourselves as
a self in the world but also other

1016
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:55,839
a self in the world but also other
 

1017
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,690
a self in the world but also other
aspects of higher-level intelligence and

1018
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:57,700
aspects of higher-level intelligence and
 

1019
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,829
aspects of higher-level intelligence and
cognition that are not just about

1020
00:16:58,829 --> 00:16:58,839
cognition that are not just about
 

1021
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:00,750
cognition that are not just about
perception like symbols right to

1022
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:00,760
perception like symbols right to
 

1023
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,540
perception like symbols right to
describe even to ourselves what's around

1024
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:03,550
describe even to ourselves what's around
 

1025
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,429
describe even to ourselves what's around
us and where we are and what we can do

1026
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:05,439
us and where we are and what we can do
 

1027
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:05,880
us and where we are and what we can do
with it

1028
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:05,890
with it
 

1029
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,829
with it
you have to go beyond just what we would

1030
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:07,839
you have to go beyond just what we would
 

1031
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,750
you have to go beyond just what we would
normally call the stuff of perception to

1032
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:09,760
normally call the stuff of perception to
 

1033
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,090
normally call the stuff of perception to
say the thoughts in somebody's head and

1034
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:12,100
say the thoughts in somebody's head and
 

1035
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,949
say the thoughts in somebody's head and
your own thoughts about that okay so

1036
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:13,959
your own thoughts about that okay so
 

1037
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:16,799
your own thoughts about that okay so
what we've been doing in CBMM is trying

1038
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:16,809
what we've been doing in CBMM is trying
 

1039
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:18,600
what we've been doing in CBMM is trying
to develop an architecture for visual

1040
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:18,610
to develop an architecture for visual
 

1041
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,549
to develop an architecture for visual
intelligence and I'm not going to go

1042
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:20,559
intelligence and I'm not going to go
 

1043
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,929
intelligence and I'm not going to go
into any of the details of how this

1044
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:21,939
into any of the details of how this
 

1045
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:23,429
into any of the details of how this
works and this is just notional this is

1046
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:23,439
works and this is just notional this is
 

1047
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,380
works and this is just notional this is
just a picture it's like a just a sketch

1048
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:25,390
just a picture it's like a just a sketch
 

1049
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,970
just a picture it's like a just a sketch
from a grant proposal of what we say we

00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:26,980
from a grant proposal of what we say we
 

1051
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,280
from a grant proposal of what we say we
want to do but it's based on a lot of

want to do but it's based on a lot of
 

1053

want to do but it's based on a lot of
scientific understanding of how the

how these modules might work so we talk

1068
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:43,990
how these modules might work so we talk
 

1069
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,570
how these modules might work so we talk
about a sort of an early module of a

1070
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:45,580
about a sort of an early module of a
 

1071
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,159
about a sort of an early module of a
visual or perceptual stream which

1072
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:47,169
visual or perceptual stream which
 

1073
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:49,139
visual or perceptual stream which
like bottom-up visual or other

1074
00:17:49,139 --> 00:17:49,149
like bottom-up visual or other
 

1075
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:50,970
like bottom-up visual or other
perceptual input that's the kind of

1076
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:50,980
perceptual input that's the kind of
 

1077
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,470
perceptual input that's the kind of
thing that is pretty close to what we

1078
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:52,480
thing that is pretty close to what we
 

1079
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,879
thing that is pretty close to what we
currently have and say deep

1080
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:53,889
currently have and say deep
 

1081
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:56,279
currently have and say deep
convolutional neural networks but then

1082
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:56,289
convolutional neural networks but then
 

1083
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:58,440
convolutional neural networks but then
we talk about some kind of the output of

1084
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:58,450
we talk about some kind of the output of
 

1085
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,629
we talk about some kind of the output of
that isn't just pattern class labels but

1086
00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:00,639
that isn't just pattern class labels but
 

1087
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:02,279
that isn't just pattern class labels but
what we call the cognitive core core

1088
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:02,289
what we call the cognitive core core
 

1089
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,259
what we call the cognitive core core
cognition so we get an understanding of

1090
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:04,269
cognition so we get an understanding of
 

1091
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:06,359
cognition so we get an understanding of
space and objects there physics

1092
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:06,369
space and objects there physics
 

1093

other people their minds that's the real
 

1095
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:10,560
other people their minds that's the real
stuff of cognition that has to be the

00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:10,570
stuff of cognition that has to be the
 

1097
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:13,379
stuff of cognition that has to be the
output of perception but somehow we have

1098
00:18:13,379 --> 00:18:13,389
output of perception but somehow we have
 

1099
00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:15,090
output of perception but somehow we have
to we have we have to have this is what

00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:15,100
to we have we have to have this is what
 

1101
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,249
to we have we have to have this is what
we call the brain OS in this picture we

we call the brain OS in this picture we
 

1103
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:18,720
we call the brain OS in this picture we
have to get there by stitching together

have to get there by stitching together
 

1105
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,210
have to get there by stitching together
the bottom-up inputs from glimpse here a

what's out there in the world and then

1118
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:33,159
what's out there in the world and then
 

1119
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:34,680
what's out there in the world and then
if we're going to start to talk about it

1120
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:34,690
if we're going to start to talk about it
 

1121
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,399
if we're going to start to talk about it
in language or to build plans on top of

00:18:38,399 --> 00:18:38,409
in language or to build plans on top of
 

1123
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,979
in language or to build plans on top of
what we have seen and understood that's

1124
00:18:40,979 --> 00:18:40,989
what we have seen and understood that's
 

1125
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:42,899
what we have seen and understood that's
where we talk about symbols coming into

1126
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:42,909
where we talk about symbols coming into
 

1127
00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:45,539
where we talk about symbols coming into
the picture ok the building blocks of

1128
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:45,549
the picture ok the building blocks of
 

1129
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:49,739
the picture ok the building blocks of
language and plans and so on so now we

1130
00:18:49,739 --> 00:18:49,749
language and plans and so on so now we
 

1131
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:51,180
language and plans and so on so now we
might say well ok this is an

1132
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:51,190
might say well ok this is an
 

1133
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,639
might say well ok this is an
architecture that is brain inspired and

1134
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:53,649
architecture that is brain inspired and
 

1135
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:55,320
architecture that is brain inspired and
cognitively inspired and and we're

1136
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:55,330
cognitively inspired and and we're
 

1137
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,909
cognitively inspired and and we're
planning to turn into real engineering

1138
00:18:56,909 --> 00:18:56,919
planning to turn into real engineering
 

1139
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:58,680

and you can say well do we need that

1140
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:58,690
and you can say well do we need that
 

1141
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,239

maybe you know again I know this is a
 

1143
00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:01,799
maybe you know again I know this is a
question you considered in the first

1144
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:01,809

maybe the engineering toolkit that's

1148
00:19:04,229 --> 00:19:04,239
maybe the engineering toolkit that's
 

1149
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:06,239
maybe the engineering toolkit that's
currently been making a lot of progress

1150
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:06,249
currently been making a lot of progress
 

1151
00:19:06,249 --> 00:19:08,220
currently been making a lot of progress
in let's say industry maybe that's good

1152
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:08,230
in let's say industry maybe that's good
 

1153
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,080
in let's say industry maybe that's good
enough maybe you know let's take deep

1154
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,090
enough maybe you know let's take deep
 

1155
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,180
enough maybe you know let's take deep

reinforcement learning based tools and
 

1161
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:19,409
reinforcement learning based tools and
say ok well maybe that can scale up to

1162
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:19,419
say ok well maybe that can scale up to
 

1163
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:21,899
say ok well maybe that can scale up to
this and you might you know it but maybe

1164
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:21,909
this and you might you know it but maybe
 

1165
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:23,399
this and you might you know it but maybe
that's that's possible I'm happy in the

1166
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:23,409
that's that's possible I'm happy in the
 

1167

this my sense is no I think that it's

1170
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:28,359
this my sense is no I think that it's
 

1171
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:30,419
this my sense is no I think that it's
not when I say no I don't mean like it

1172
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:30,429
not when I say no I don't mean like it
 

1173
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:32,639
not when I say no I don't mean like it
can't happen or it won't happen what I

1174
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:32,649
can't happen or it won't happen what I
 

1175
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:34,440
can't happen or it won't happen what I
mean is the highest value the highest

1176
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:34,450
mean is the highest value the highest
 

1177
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,629
mean is the highest value the highest
expected route right now is to take this

1178
00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:36,639
expected route right now is to take this
 

1179
00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:38,220
expected route right now is to take this

approach and that if at least if you

1182
00:19:40,739 --> 00:19:40,749
approach and that if at least if you
 

1183
00:19:40,749 --> 00:19:42,599
approach and that if at least if you
follow the current trajectory that

and a held-out test set where the goal
was to take an image and write a

1268
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:02,730
was to take an image and write a
 

1269
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,060
was to take an image and write a
sentence like a short sentence caption

1270
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:05,070
sentence like a short sentence caption
 

1271
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,190
sentence like a short sentence caption
that that would seem like the kind of

1272
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,200
that that would seem like the kind of
 

1273
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,659
that that would seem like the kind of
way a human would describe that image

1274
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:08,669
way a human would describe that image
 

1275
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:11,090
way a human would describe that image
and these systems you know surpassed

1276
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:11,100
and these systems you know surpassed
 

1277
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,519
and these systems you know surpassed
human level accuracy on the held-out

1278
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:13,529
human level accuracy on the held-out
 

1279
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:15,350
human level accuracy on the held-out
test set from a big training set but

1280
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:15,360
test set from a big training set but
 

1281
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,090
test set from a big training set but
what you can see when you really dig

1282
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:17,100
what you can see when you really dig
 

1283
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,440
what you can see when you really dig
into these things is there's often a lot

1284
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:18,450
into these things is there's often a lot
 

1285
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,240
into these things is there's often a lot
of what I would call data set

1286
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,250
of what I would call data set
 

1287
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,830
of what I would call data set
overfitting it's not overfitting to the

know wherever ever came from certain set
 

1297
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,470
know wherever ever came from certain set
of photographs and certain ways of

of photographs and certain ways of
 

1299
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,810
of photographs and certain ways of
captioning them okay which even a big

1300
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:32,820
captioning them okay which even a big
 

1301
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,299
captioning them okay which even a big
data set it's not about quantity it's

data set it's not about quantity it's
 

1303
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:36,889
data set it's not about quantity it's
more about the quality the nature of

more about the quality the nature of

way to test this system is to apply it

1308
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,240
way to test this system is to apply it
 

1309
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,210
way to test this system is to apply it
to what seems like basically the same

1310
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:44,220
to what seems like basically the same
 

1311
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,509
to what seems like basically the same
problem but not within the a certain

problem but not within the a certain
 

1313
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:49,490
problem but not within the a certain
curated or built data set and there's a

00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:49,500
curated or built data set and there's a
 

1315
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,440
curated or built data set and there's a
convenient Twitter bot that lets you do

1316
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:51,450
convenient Twitter bot that lets you do
 

1317
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,120
convenient Twitter bot that lets you do
this so there's something called the pic

I'm not trying to critique these systems

1326
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:01,470
I'm not trying to critique these systems
 

1327
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,419
I'm not trying to critique these systems
for what they're trying to do I'm just

1328
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:02,429
for what they're trying to do I'm just
 

1329
00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:03,649
for what they're trying to do I'm just
trying to point out what they don't

1330
00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:03,659
trying to point out what they don't
 

1331
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:05,570
trying to point out what they don't
really even try to do so this takes the

1332
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:05,580
really even try to do so this takes the
 

1333
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,779
really even try to do so this takes the
microsoft caption bot and just every

1334
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:08,789
microsoft caption bot and just every
 

1335
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:10,460
microsoft caption bot and just every
couple of hours takes a random image

1336
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:10,470
couple of hours takes a random image
 

1337
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,560
couple of hours takes a random image
from the web captions it and upload

1338
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:12,570
from the web captions it and upload
 

1339
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,419
from the web captions it and upload
the results to Twitter and a couple of

1340
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:14,429
the results to Twitter and a couple of
 

1341
00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:15,799
the results to Twitter and a couple of
months ago when I prepared a first

1342
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:15,809
months ago when I prepared a first
 

1343
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:17,960
months ago when I prepared a first
version of this talk I just took a few

1344
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:17,970
version of this talk I just took a few
 

1345
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,700
version of this talk I just took a few
days in the life of this Twitter bot I

1346
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:19,710
days in the life of this Twitter bot I
 

1347
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,769
days in the life of this Twitter bot I
didn't take every single image but I

1348
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:21,779
didn't take every single image but I
 

1349
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:23,840
didn't take every single image but I
took you know most of the images in a

1350
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:23,850
took you know most of the images in a
 

1351
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,680
took you know most of the images in a
way that was meant to be representative

1352
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:24,690
way that was meant to be representative
 

1353
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,810
way that was meant to be representative
of the successes and the kinds of

1354
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:26,820
of the successes and the kinds of
 

1355
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,460
of the successes and the kinds of
failures that such a system will make so

1356
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:28,470
failures that such a system will make so
 

1357
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,990
failures that such a system will make so
we can go through this and it's a little

1358
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,000
we can go through this and it's a little
 

1359
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,310
we can go through this and it's a little
bit entertaining and I think quite

1360
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:31,320
bit entertaining and I think quite
 

1361
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,409
bit entertaining and I think quite
informative so here's just a somewhat

1362
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:33,419
informative so here's just a somewhat
 

1363
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:37,249
informative so here's just a somewhat
random sample of a few days in the life

1364
00:22:37,249 --> 00:22:37,259
random sample of a few days in the life
 

1365
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:39,649
random sample of a few days in the life
of one of these caption BOTS so here we

1366
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:39,659
of one of these caption BOTS so here we
 

1367
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:42,590
of one of these caption BOTS so here we
have a picture of a person holding for

1368
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:42,600
have a picture of a person holding for
 

1369
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,360
have a picture of a person holding for
tonight my screen is very small here and

1370
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:44,370
tonight my screen is very small here and
 

1371
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,470
tonight my screen is very small here and
I can't read up there so maybe you'll

1372
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:45,480
I can't read up there so maybe you'll
 

1373
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,879
I can't read up there so maybe you'll
have to tell me was that but a person

1374
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:46,889
have to tell me was that but a person
 

1375
00:22:46,889 --> 00:22:48,080
have to tell me was that but a person
holding a cell phone I guess I'll just

1376
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,090
holding a cell phone I guess I'll just
 

1377
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,669
holding a cell phone I guess I'll just
read along with you so have a person

1378
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:49,679
read along with you so have a person
 

1379
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:50,749
read along with you so have a person
holding a cell phone well it's not a

1380
00:22:50,749 --> 00:22:50,759
holding a cell phone well it's not a
 

1381
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:52,070
holding a cell phone well it's not a
person holding a cell phone but it's

1382
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,080
person holding a cell phone but it's
 

1383
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,690
person holding a cell phone but it's
kind of close it's a person holding some

1384
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:53,700
kind of close it's a person holding some
 

1385
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,669
kind of close it's a person holding some
kind of machine so I don't even know

1386
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:55,679
kind of machine so I don't even know
 

1387
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:56,690
kind of machine so I don't even know
what that is but it's some kind of

1388
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:56,700
what that is but it's some kind of
 

1389
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,720
what that is but it's some kind of
musical instrument right

1390
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:58,730
musical instrument right
 

1391
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:01,399
musical instrument right
so that's a mixed success or failure

1392
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:01,409
so that's a mixed success or failure
 

1393
00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:03,080
so that's a mixed success or failure
here's some pretty good one a group of

1394
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,090
here's some pretty good one a group of
 

1395
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,879
here's some pretty good one a group of
people on a on a field playing football

1396
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:04,889
people on a on a field playing football
 

1397
00:23:04,889 --> 00:23:06,950
people on a on a field playing football
that's I would call that a you know a

1398
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:06,960
that's I would call that a you know a
 

1399
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,669
that's I would call that a you know a
result maybe even A+ here's a group of

1400
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:10,679
result maybe even A+ here's a group of
 

1401
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:12,590
result maybe even A+ here's a group of
people standing on top of a mountain

1402
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:12,600
people standing on top of a mountain
 

1403
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,360
people standing on top of a mountain
so less good there's a mountain but as

1404
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:14,370
so less good there's a mountain but as
 

1405
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,470
so less good there's a mountain but as
far as I can tell there's no people but

1406
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:15,480
far as I can tell there's no people but
 

1407
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,480
far as I can tell there's no people but
these systems like to see people because

1408
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:17,490
these systems like to see people because
 

1409
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,190
these systems like to see people because
of both the combination because in the

1410
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:19,200
of both the combination because in the
 

1411
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,419
of both the combination because in the
data set they were trained on there's a

1412
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:20,429
data set they were trained on there's a
 

1413
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:21,619
data set they were trained on there's a
lot of people and people often talk

1414
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:21,629
lot of people and people often talk
 

1415
00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:25,129
lot of people and people often talk
about people okay I mean and the fact

1416
00:23:25,129 --> 00:23:25,139
about people okay I mean and the fact
 

1417
00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:26,629
about people okay I mean and the fact
that you can appreciate both what I said

1418
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:26,639
that you can appreciate both what I said
 

1419

some of my cognitive activities that

1422
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:30,419
some of my cognitive activities that
 

1423
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:31,909
some of my cognitive activities that
this system is not even trying to do

this system is not even trying to do

okay here we've got a building with the

1426
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:33,720
okay here we've got a building with the
 

1427
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,749
okay here we've got a building with the
cake I'll go through these fast building

1428
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:35,759
cake I'll go through these fast building
 

1429
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:37,999
cake I'll go through these fast building
with the cake a large stone building

1430
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:38,009
with the cake a large stone building
 

1431
00:23:38,009 --> 00:23:39,169
with the cake a large stone building
with the clock tower I think that's

1432
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:39,179
with the clock tower I think that's
 

1433
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:40,340
with the clock tower I think that's
pretty good I'd give that like a b-plus

1434
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:40,350
pretty good I'd give that like a b-plus
 

1435
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,379
pretty good I'd give that like a b-plus
there's no clock but it's plausibly

1436
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:42,389
there's no clock but it's plausibly
 

1437
00:23:42,389 --> 00:23:44,269
there's no clock but it's plausibly
right there might be a clock in there

1438
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:44,279
right there might be a clock in there
 

1439
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:45,409
right there might be a clock in there
there's definitely something like that

1440
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:45,419
there's definitely something like that
 

1441
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:47,240
there's definitely something like that

they've improved at some you know I this
 

1571
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,620
they've improved at some you know I this
is partly for entertainment values you

1572
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:56,630
is partly for entertainment values you
 

1573
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,029
is partly for entertainment values you
know I chose what also would be the

1574
00:25:58,029 --> 00:25:58,039
know I chose what also would be the
 

1575
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:59,980
know I chose what also would be the
funnier example so I'm quite I want to

1576
00:25:59,980 --> 00:25:59,990
funnier example so I'm quite I want to
 

1577
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,120
funnier example so I'm quite I want to
be quite honest about it and these are

1578
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,130
be quite honest about it and these are
 

1579
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,830
be quite honest about it and these are
I'm not trying to take away what our

1580
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:02,840
I'm not trying to take away what our
 

1581
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,159
I'm not trying to take away what our
impressive AI technologies but I think

1582
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:06,169
impressive AI technologies but I think
 

1583
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:07,450
impressive AI technologies but I think
it's clear that there's a sense of

1584
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:07,460
it's clear that there's a sense of
 

1585
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,130
it's clear that there's a sense of
understanding any one of these images

1586
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:09,140
understanding any one of these images
 

1587
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,899
understanding any one of these images
that it's important to see that even

1588
00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:10,909
that it's important to see that even
 

1589
00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:13,330
that it's important to see that even
when it seems to be correct right if it

1590
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:13,340
when it seems to be correct right if it
 

1591
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,710
when it seems to be correct right if it
can make the kind of errors that it

1592
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:14,720
can make the kind of errors that it
 

1593
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,750
can make the kind of errors that it
makes that even when it seems to be

1594
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:16,760
makes that even when it seems to be
 

1595
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,610
makes that even when it seems to be
correct it's probably not doing what

1596
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:18,620
correct it's probably not doing what
 

1597
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,230
correct it's probably not doing what
you're doing and it's probably not even

1598
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:20,240
you're doing and it's probably not even
 

1599
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,060
you're doing and it's probably not even
trying to scale towards the dimensions

1600
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,070
trying to scale towards the dimensions
 

1601
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,620
trying to scale towards the dimensions
of intelligence that we think about when

1602
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:23,630
of intelligence that we think about when
 

1603
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,210
of intelligence that we think about when
we're talking about human intelligence

1604
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:25,220
we're talking about human intelligence
 

1605
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,760
we're talking about human intelligence
okay another way to put this I'm going

1606
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:27,770
okay another way to put this I'm going
 

1607
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,260
okay another way to put this I'm going
to show you a really insightful blog

got his PhD from Stanford he did he
worked at Google a little bit on some

1626
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:48,110
worked at Google a little bit on some
 

1627
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,440
worked at Google a little bit on some
early big neural net AI projects there

1628
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:50,450
early big neural net AI projects there
 

1629
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,840
early big neural net AI projects there
he was an open AI he was one of the

he was an open AI he was one of the
founders of open AI and recently he

research but about five years ago he was

1636
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:00,500
research but about five years ago he was
 

1637
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,230
research but about five years ago he was
looking at the state of computer vision

1638
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:02,240
looking at the state of computer vision
 

1639
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,210
looking at the state of computer vision
from a human intelligence point of view

1640
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:04,220
from a human intelligence point of view
 

1641
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,250
from a human intelligence point of view
and and lamenting how far away we were

1642
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:06,260
and and lamenting how far away we were
 

1643
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,750
and and lamenting how far away we were
okay so this is the title of his blog

1644
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:07,760
okay so this is the title of his blog
 

1645
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,010
okay so this is the title of his blog
post the state of computer vision

1646
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:09,020
post the state of computer vision
 

1647
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,500
post the state of computer vision
nai-nai we are really really far away

1648
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:11,510
nai-nai we are really really far away
 

1649
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:15,370
nai-nai we are really really far away
and he took this image which was a sort

1650
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:15,380
and he took this image which was a sort
 

1651
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,990
and he took this image which was a sort
of a famous image in its own right it

1652
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:17,000
of a famous image in its own right it
 

1653
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,060
of a famous image in its own right it
was a popular image of Obama back when

1654
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:19,070
was a popular image of Obama back when
 

1655
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,560
was a popular image of Obama back when
he was president kind of playing around

1656
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:20,570
he was president kind of playing around
 

1657
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,299
he was president kind of playing around
as he liked to do when he was on tour so

1658
00:27:22,299 --> 00:27:22,309
as he liked to do when he was on tour so
 

1659
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,220
as he liked to do when he was on tour so
if you take a look at this you can see

1660
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:24,230
if you take a look at this you can see
 

1661
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,960
if you take a look at this you can see
you probably all can recognize the

1662
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:25,970
you probably all can recognize the
 

1663
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,400
you probably all can recognize the
previous President of the United States

1664
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:27,410
previous President of the United States
 

1665
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,710
previous President of the United States
but you can also get the sense of where

1666
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:29,720
but you can also get the sense of where
 

1667
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,480
but you can also get the sense of where
he is and what's going on and you might

1668
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:31,490
he is and what's going on and you might
 

1669
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,890
he is and what's going on and you might
see people smiling and you might get the

1670
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:32,900
see people smiling and you might get the
 

1671
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,210
see people smiling and you might get the
sense that he's playing a joke on

1672
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:34,220
sense that he's playing a joke on
 

1673
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,000
sense that he's playing a joke on
someone can you see that right so how do

1674
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,010
someone can you see that right so how do
 

1675
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,289
someone can you see that right so how do
you know that he's playing a joke and

1676
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:38,299
you know that he's playing a joke and
 

1677
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:41,350
you know that he's playing a joke and
what that joke is well as Andre goes on

1678
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:41,360
what that joke is well as Andre goes on
 

1679
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,150
what that joke is well as Andre goes on
to talk about in his blog post too if

1680
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:43,160
to talk about in his blog post too if
 

1681
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,830
to talk about in his blog post too if
you think about all the things that that

1682
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:44,840
you think about all the things that that
 

1683
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,110
you think about all the things that that
you have to really deploy in your mind

1684
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,120
you have to really deploy in your mind
 

1685
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,330
you have to really deploy in your mind
to understand that it's a huge list of

1686
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:49,340
to understand that it's a huge list of
 

1687
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,010
to understand that it's a huge list of
course it starts with seeing people and

1688
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:51,020
course it starts with seeing people and
 

1689
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,390
course it starts with seeing people and
objects and maybe doing some face

1690
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:52,400
objects and maybe doing some face
 

1691
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,190
objects and maybe doing some face
recognition but you have to do things

1692
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:54,200
recognition but you have to do things
 

1693
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,470
recognition but you have to do things
like for example notice his foot on the

1694
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:56,480
like for example notice his foot on the
 

1695
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,419
like for example notice his foot on the
scale and understand enough about how

1696
00:27:58,419 --> 00:27:58,429
scale and understand enough about how
 

1697
00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:00,400
scale and understand enough about how
scales work that when a foot presses

1698
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:00,410
scales work that when a foot presses
 

1699
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,990
scales work that when a foot presses
down it exerts force that the scale is

1700
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,000
down it exerts force that the scale is
 

1701
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,789
down it exerts force that the scale is
sensitive doesn't just magically measure

1702
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:03,799
sensitive doesn't just magically measure
 

1703
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,200
sensitive doesn't just magically measure
people's weight but it does that somehow

1704
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,210
people's weight but it does that somehow
 

1705
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:07,630
people's weight but it does that somehow
through force you have to see who can

1706
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:07,640
through force you have to see who can
 

1707
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,100
through force you have to see who can
see that he's doing that and who can't

1708
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,110
see that he's doing that and who can't
 

1709
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,570
see that he's doing that and who can't
who cannot see that he's doing that

1710
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:10,580
who cannot see that he's doing that
 

1711
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,280
who cannot see that he's doing that
right in particularly the person on the

1712
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:12,290
right in particularly the person on the
 

1713
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,530
right in particularly the person on the
scale and why some people can see that

1714
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:14,540
scale and why some people can see that
 

1715
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,789
scale and why some people can see that
he's doing that and can see that some

1716
00:28:15,789 --> 00:28:15,799
he's doing that and can see that some
 

1717
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:17,680
he's doing that and can see that some
other people can't see it why that makes

1718
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:17,690
other people can't see it why that makes
 

1719
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,620
other people can't see it why that makes
it funny to them okay and someday we

1720
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:20,630
it funny to them okay and someday we
 

1721
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,510
it funny to them okay and someday we
should have machines that can understand

1722
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:22,520
should have machines that can understand
 

1723
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,419
should have machines that can understand
this but hopefully you can see why what

1724
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:25,429
this but hopefully you can see why what
 

1725
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:27,700
this but hopefully you can see why what
I would I what the kind of architecture

1726
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:27,710
I would I what the kind of architecture
 

1727
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,130
I would I what the kind of architecture
that I'm talking about would be the

1728
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:30,140
that I'm talking about would be the
 

1729
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,039
that I'm talking about would be the
building blocks of the ingredients to be

1730
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:33,049
building blocks of the ingredients to be
 

1731
00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:35,049
building blocks of the ingredients to be
able to get them to do that now I when I

1732
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:35,059
able to get them to do that now I when I
 

1733
00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:36,909
able to get them to do that now I when I
again I prepared a version of this talk

1734
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:36,919
again I prepared a version of this talk
 

1735
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:38,440
again I prepared a version of this talk
a few months ago and I wrote to Andre

1736
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:38,450
a few months ago and I wrote to Andre
 

1737
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,180
a few months ago and I wrote to Andre
and I said I was gonna use this and I

1738
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:40,190
and I said I was gonna use this and I
 

1739
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,370
and I said I was gonna use this and I
was curious if he how what you know if

1740
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:42,380
was curious if he how what you know if
 

1741
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,740
was curious if he how what you know if
he had any reflections on this and where

1742
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:44,750
he had any reflections on this and where
 

1743
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,630
he had any reflections on this and where
he thought we were relative to five

1744
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:46,640
he thought we were relative to five
 

1745
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,800
he thought we were relative to five
years ago because a certain

1746
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:47,810
years ago because a certain
 

1747
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,930
years ago because a certain
a lot of progress has been made but he

1748
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:49,940
a lot of progress has been made but he
 

1749
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,420
a lot of progress has been made but he
said here's his email I hope he doesn't

1750
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:52,430
said here's his email I hope he doesn't
 

1751
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,830
said here's his email I hope he doesn't
mind me sharing it but I mean again he's

1752
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:53,840
mind me sharing it but I mean again he's
 

1753
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,360
mind me sharing it but I mean again he's
a very honest person and that's one of

1754
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:55,370
a very honest person and that's one of
 

1755
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,770
a very honest person and that's one of
the many reasons why he's such an

1756
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:56,780
the many reasons why he's such an
 

1757
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,660
the many reasons why he's such an
important person right now in AI okay

1758
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:58,670
important person right now in AI okay
 

1759
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,190
important person right now in AI okay
he's both very technically strong and

1760
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:00,200
he's both very technically strong and
 

1761
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,420
he's both very technically strong and
honest about what we can do what we

1762
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:01,430
honest about what we can do what we
 

1763
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,040
honest about what we can do what we
can't do and as he says well what does

1764
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,050
can't do and as he says well what does
 

1765
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:05,290
can't do and as he says well what does
he say it's nice to hear from you it's

1766
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:05,300
he say it's nice to hear from you it's
 

1767
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,250
he say it's nice to hear from you it's
funny you should bring this up I was

1768
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:06,260
funny you should bring this up I was
 

1769
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,160
funny you should bring this up I was
also thinking about writing a a return

1770
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,170
also thinking about writing a a return
 

1771
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,600
also thinking about writing a a return
to this and in short basically I don't

1772
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:10,610
to this and in short basically I don't
 

1773
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,530
to this and in short basically I don't
believe we've made very much progress

1774
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:11,540
believe we've made very much progress
 

1775
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,780
believe we've made very much progress
right he points out that in his long

1776
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:13,790
right he points out that in his long
 

1777
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,520
right he points out that in his long
list of things that you'd need to

1778
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:15,530
list of things that you'd need to
 

1779
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,660
list of things that you'd need to
understand the image we have made

1780
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:16,670
understand the image we have made
 

1781
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,340
understand the image we have made
progress on some the ability to again

1782
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:18,350
progress on some the ability to again
 

1783
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,050
progress on some the ability to again
detect people and do face recognition

1784
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:20,060
detect people and do face recognition
 

1785
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,690
detect people and do face recognition
for well-known individuals okay but

1786
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:22,700
for well-known individuals okay but
 

1787
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,190
for well-known individuals okay but
that's kind of about it all right

1788
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:24,200
that's kind of about it all right
 

1789
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,530
that's kind of about it all right
and he wasn't particularly optimistic

1790
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:26,540
and he wasn't particularly optimistic
 

1791
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,670
and he wasn't particularly optimistic
that the current route that's being

1792
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:27,680
that the current route that's being
 

1793
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,980
that the current route that's being
pursued an industry is is anywhere close

1794
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:29,990
pursued an industry is is anywhere close
 

1795
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,140
pursued an industry is is anywhere close
to solving or even really trying to

1796
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:32,150
to solving or even really trying to
 

1797
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,020
to solving or even really trying to
solve these larger questions um if we

1798
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,030
solve these larger questions um if we
 

1799
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:38,590
solve these larger questions um if we
give this image to that caption bot you

1800
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:38,600
give this image to that caption bot you
 

1801
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,570
give this image to that caption bot you
know what we see is again represents the

1802
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:40,580
know what we see is again represents the
 

1803
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,130
know what we see is again represents the
same point so here's the caption bot it

1804
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:42,140
same point so here's the caption bot it
 

1805
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,420
same point so here's the caption bot it
says I think it's a group of people

1806
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:43,430
says I think it's a group of people
 

1807
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,370
says I think it's a group of people
standing next to a man in a suit and tie

1808
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:45,380
standing next to a man in a suit and tie
 

1809
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:49,000
standing next to a man in a suit and tie
right so that's right right as far as it

1810
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,010
right so that's right right as far as it
 

1811
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,920
right so that's right right as far as it
goes it just doesn't go far enough and

1812
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:50,930
goes it just doesn't go far enough and
 

1813
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:53,590
goes it just doesn't go far enough and

00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:01,580
even I would venture trying to get to
 

1821
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,850
even I would venture trying to get to
what we're talking about or here's

00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:03,860
what we're talking about or here's
 

1823
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,840
what we're talking about or here's

00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:11,630
tropical look how which I think
 

1831
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,450
tropical look how which I think
illustrates ways in which again the gap

1832
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:13,460
illustrates ways in which again the gap
 

1833
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:17,470
illustrates ways in which again the gap
where we have machines that can say beat

1834
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:17,480
where we have machines that can say beat
 

1835
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,810
where we have machines that can say beat
the world's best at go but can't even

beat a child at tick-tack-toe

1838
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:21,350
beat a child at tick-tack-toe
 

1839
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,080
beat a child at tick-tack-toe
now what do I mean by that well you know

1840
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,090
now what do I mean by that well you know
 

1841
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,030
now what do I mean by that well you know
of course we can build we don't even

1842
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:25,040
of course we can build we don't even
 

1843
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,290
of course we can build we don't even
need reinforcement learning or deep

1844
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:26,300
need reinforcement learning or deep

in tic-tac-toe but think about this this

1850
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:32,000
in tic-tac-toe but think about this this
 

1851
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,910
in tic-tac-toe but think about this this
is a real tic-tac-toe game which I saw

1852
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:33,920
is a real tic-tac-toe game which I saw
 

1853
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,060
is a real tic-tac-toe game which I saw
on the grass outside my hotel right what

1854
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:37,070
on the grass outside my hotel right what
 

1855
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,320
on the grass outside my hotel right what
do you have to do to look at this and

1856
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,330
do you have to do to look at this and
 

1857
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,670
do you have to do to look at this and
recognize that it's a tic-tac-toe game

1858
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:39,680
recognize that it's a tic-tac-toe game
 

1859
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,710
recognize that it's a tic-tac-toe game
you have to see the objects you have to

1860
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:41,720
you have to see the objects you have to
 

1861
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,730
you have to see the objects you have to
see what's you know in some sense

1862
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:42,740
see what's you know in some sense
 

1863
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,890
see what's you know in some sense
there's a three by three grid but it's

1864
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:44,900
there's a three by three grid but it's
 

1865
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,870
there's a three by three grid but it's
but it's only abstract right it's only

1866
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:46,880
but it's only abstract right it's only
 

1867
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,820
but it's only abstract right it's only
delimited by this these ropes or strings

1868
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:48,830
delimited by this these ropes or strings
 

1869
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:52,660
delimited by this these ropes or strings
okay it's not actually a grid in any

1870
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:52,670
okay it's not actually a grid in any
 

1871
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:55,060
okay it's not actually a grid in any
simple geometric sense all right but yet

1872
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:55,070
simple geometric sense all right but yet
 

1873
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,530
simple geometric sense all right but yet
a child can look at that and indeed

1874
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:56,540
a child can look at that and indeed
 

1875
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,910
a child can look at that and indeed
here's an actual child who was looking

1876
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:57,920
here's an actual child who was looking
 

1877
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,470
here's an actual child who was looking
at it and recognized oh it's a game of

1878
00:30:59,470 --> 00:30:59,480
at it and recognized oh it's a game of
 

1879
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,120
at it and recognized oh it's a game of
tic-tac-toe and even know what they need

1880
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,130
tic-tac-toe and even know what they need
 

1881
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:01,720
tic-tac-toe and even know what they need
to do to win

1882
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:01,730
to do to win
 

1883
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,190
to do to win
we put the X and completed and now

1884
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:03,200
we put the X and completed and now
 

1885
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,480
we put the X and completed and now
they've got three in a row right that's

1886
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:04,490
they've got three in a row right that's
 

1887
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:07,000
they've got three in a row right that's
that's literally child's play okay

1888
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,010
that's literally child's play okay
 

1889
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,530
that's literally child's play okay
you showed this sort of thing though to

1890
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:08,540
you showed this sort of thing though to
 

1891
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,790
you showed this sort of thing though to
one of these you know image

one of these you know image
 

1893
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,250
one of these you know image
understanding caption BOTS and I think

1894
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:12,260
understanding caption BOTS and I think
 

1895
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,740
understanding caption BOTS and I think
it's a close-up of a sign okay again

1896
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:14,750
it's a close-up of a sign okay again
 

1897
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,480
it's a close-up of a sign okay again
it's not like saying that this is a

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:16,490
it's not like saying that this is a
 

1899

that's going to give us what we need to

1906
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,230
that's going to give us what we need to
 

1907
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,930
that's going to give us what we need to
say recognize the objects to recognize

things ultimately right and I bring in
these examples of games or jokes to

1920
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:41,270
these examples of games or jokes to
 

1921
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,630
these examples of games or jokes to
really show where perception goes to

1922

really show where perception goes to
 

1923
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,240
really show where perception goes to
cognition you know that and all the way

1924
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:46,250
cognition you know that and all the way
 

1925
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,490
cognition you know that and all the way
up to symbols right so to get objects

1926
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:48,500
up to symbols right so to get objects
 

1927
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,700
up to symbols right so to get objects
and forces and mental states that's the

1928
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:51,710
and forces and mental states that's the
 

1929
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,740
and forces and mental states that's the
cognitive core but to be able to get

1930
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:53,750
cognitive core but to be able to get
 

1931
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,350
cognitive core but to be able to get
goals and plans and what do I do or how

goals and plans and what do I do or how
 

1933
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,860
goals and plans and what do I do or how
do I talk about it that's symbols okay

1934
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:58,870
do I talk about it that's symbols okay
 

1935
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:01,270
do I talk about it that's symbols okay
here's another way into this and it's

1936
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:01,280
here's another way into this and it's
 

1937
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,860
here's another way into this and it's
one that also motivates I think a lot of

1938
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:02,870
one that also motivates I think a lot of
 

1939
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,420
one that also motivates I think a lot of
really good work on the engineering side

really good work on the engineering side
 

1941
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,880
really good work on the engineering side
and a lot of our interest in the science

1942
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:06,890
and a lot of our interest in the science
 

1943
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,040
and a lot of our interest in the science
side is think about robotics and think

1944
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,050
side is think about robotics and think
 

1945
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,740
side is think about robotics and think
about what do you have to do to you know

1946
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:11,750
about what do you have to do to you know
 

1947
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,270
about what do you have to do to you know
what is the brain have to be light to

1948
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:13,280
what is the brain have to be light to
 

1949
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,130
what is the brain have to be light to
control the body so again you're gonna

1950
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:15,140
control the body so again you're gonna
 

1951
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,650
control the body so again you're gonna
hear from shortly I think maybe it's

1952
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:17,660
hear from shortly I think maybe it's

really awesome impressive stuff okay um

1974
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:43,760
really awesome impressive stuff okay um
 

1975
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,150
really awesome impressive stuff okay um
but what about the minds and brains of

1976
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:46,160
but what about the minds and brains of
 

1977
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,710
but what about the minds and brains of
these robots well again if you ask mark

1978
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:47,720
these robots well again if you ask mark
 

1979
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,350
these robots well again if you ask mark
ask them how much of human-like

1980
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:50,360
ask them how much of human-like
 

1981
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,970
ask them how much of human-like
cognition do they have in their robots

1982
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:51,980
cognition do they have in their robots
 

1983
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,490
cognition do they have in their robots
and I think he would say very little in

1984
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:54,500
and I think he would say very little in
 

1985
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,900
and I think he would say very little in
fact we have asked him that and he would

1986
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:55,910
fact we have asked him that and he would
 

1987
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:58,560
fact we have asked him that and he would
say very little he has said very little

1988
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:58,570
say very little he has said very little
 

1989
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,910
say very little he has said very little
he's actually one of the advisors of our

1990
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:00,920
he's actually one of the advisors of our
 

1991
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,710
he's actually one of the advisors of our
Center and I think in many ways were

1992
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:02,720
Center and I think in many ways were
 

1993
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,540
Center and I think in many ways were
very much on the same page we both want

1994
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:04,550
very much on the same page we both want
 

1995
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,310
very much on the same page we both want
to know how do you build the kind of

1996
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:06,320
to know how do you build the kind of
 

1997
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,690
to know how do you build the kind of
intelligence that can control these

1998
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:07,700
intelligence that can control these
 

1999
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,020
intelligence that can control these
bodies like the way a human does alright

2000
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,030
bodies like the way a human does alright
 

2001
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,730
bodies like the way a human does alright
um here's another example of an industry

2002
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:12,740
um here's another example of an industry
 

2003
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,170
um here's another example of an industry
robotics effort this is Google's arm

2004
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:14,180
robotics effort this is Google's arm
 

2005
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:14,780
robotics effort this is Google's arm
farm

2006
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:14,790
farm
 

2007
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,160
farm
where you know they've they've got lots

2008
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,170
where you know they've they've got lots
 

2009
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,420
where you know they've they've got lots
of robot arms and they're trying to

2010
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:17,430
of robot arms and they're trying to
 

2011
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,190
of robot arms and they're trying to
train them to pick up objects using

2012
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,200
train them to pick up objects using
 

2013
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,510
train them to pick up objects using
various kinds of deep learning and

2014
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:20,520
various kinds of deep learning and
 

2015
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,190
various kinds of deep learning and
reinforcement learning techniques and I

2016
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:22,200
reinforcement learning techniques and I
 

2017
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,690
reinforcement learning techniques and I
think it's one approach I just think

2018
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:23,700
think it's one approach I just think
 

2019
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,700
think it's one approach I just think
it's very very different from the way

2020
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:25,710
it's very very different from the way
 

2021
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,650
it's very very different from the way
humans learn to say control their body

2022
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:27,660
humans learn to say control their body
 

2023
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,840
humans learn to say control their body
and manipulate objects and you can see

2024
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:29,850
and manipulate objects and you can see
 

2025
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,220
and manipulate objects and you can see
that in terms of things that go back to

2026
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:31,230
that in terms of things that go back to
 

2027
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,150
that in terms of things that go back to
what you were saying when you're

2028
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:32,160
what you were saying when you're
 

2029
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,740
what you were saying when you're
introducing me right think about how

2030
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:33,750
introducing me right think about how
 

2031
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,750
introducing me right think about how
quickly we learn things right here you

2032
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:35,760
quickly we learn things right here you
 

2033
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,520
quickly we learn things right here you
have these the arm farm is trying to

00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:37,530
have these the arm farm is trying to
 

2035
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,590
have these the arm farm is trying to
generate you know effectively maybe if

a half year old here doing a popular
activity for many kids as a playing hmm

2066
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:14,929

 

2067
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:19,520

you see video up there I'd okay there we

2068
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:19,530
you see video up there I'd okay there we
 

2069
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,980
you see video up there I'd okay there we
go okay so he's he's on doing this

2070
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:21,990
go okay so he's he's on doing this
 

2071
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:24,350
go okay so he's he's on doing this
stacking Cup activity alright he's

2072
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:24,360
stacking Cup activity alright he's
 

2073
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,140
stacking Cup activity alright he's
stacking up cups to make a tall tower

2074
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,150
stacking up cups to make a tall tower
 

2075
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,060
stacking up cups to make a tall tower
he's got a stack of three and what you

2076
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,070
he's got a stack of three and what you
 

2077
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,409
he's got a stack of three and what you
can see for the first part of this video

2078
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:30,419
can see for the first part of this video
 

2079
00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:32,630
can see for the first part of this video
is it looks like he's trying to make a

2080
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:32,640
is it looks like he's trying to make a
 

2081
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,640
is it looks like he's trying to make a
second stack and that he's trying to

2082
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:34,650
second stack and that he's trying to
 

2083
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,800
second stack and that he's trying to
pick up at once basically he's trying to

2084
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:36,810
pick up at once basically he's trying to
 

2085
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,570
pick up at once basically he's trying to
make a stack of two that'll go on the

2086
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:38,580
make a stack of two that'll go on the
 

2087
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,450
make a stack of two that'll go on the
stack of three and you know he's trying

2088
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:41,460
stack of three and you know he's trying
 

2089
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,190
stack of three and you know he's trying
to debug his plan because it's it got a

2090
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:43,200
to debug his plan because it's it got a
 

2091
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,210
to debug his plan because it's it got a
little bit stuck here but and think

2092
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:47,220
little bit stuck here but and think
 

2093
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,409
little bit stuck here but and think
about I mean again if you know anything

2094
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:48,419
about I mean again if you know anything
 

2095
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,090
about I mean again if you know anything
about robots manipulating objects even

2096
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:50,100
about robots manipulating objects even
 

2097
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,560
about robots manipulating objects even
just what he just did no robot can

2098
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:51,570
just what he just did no robot can
 

2099
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,390
just what he just did no robot can
decide to do that and actually do it

2100
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:53,400
decide to do that and actually do it
 

2101
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,210
decide to do that and actually do it
right at some point he's almost got it

2102
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:56,220
right at some point he's almost got it
 

2103
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,740
right at some point he's almost got it
it's a little bit tricky but at some

2104
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:57,750
it's a little bit tricky but at some
 

2105
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,740
it's a little bit tricky but at some
point he's gonna get that stack of two

2106
00:34:59,740 --> 00:34:59,750
point he's gonna get that stack of two
 

2107
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,300
point he's gonna get that stack of two
he realizes he has to move that object

2108
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:02,310
he realizes he has to move that object
 

2109
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,350
he realizes he has to move that object
out of the way look at what he just did

2110
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:03,360
out of the way look at what he just did
 

2111
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,120
out of the way look at what he just did
move it out of the way use two hands to

2112
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,130
move it out of the way use two hands to
 

2113
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,920
move it out of the way use two hands to
pick it up and now he's got a stack of

2114
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:06,930
pick it up and now he's got a stack of
 

2115
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,480
pick it up and now he's got a stack of
two on a stack of three and suddenly you

2116
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:08,490
two on a stack of three and suddenly you
 

2117
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,950
two on a stack of three and suddenly you
know subgoal completed he's now got a

2118
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:09,960
know subgoal completed he's now got a
 

2119
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,960
know subgoal completed he's now got a
stack of five and he gives himself a

2120
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:11,970
stack of five and he gives himself a
 

2121
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,430
stack of five and he gives himself a
hand because he know he knows he

2122
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:13,440
hand because he know he knows he
 

2123
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,500
hand because he know he knows he
accomplished a keyway point along the

2124
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:15,510
accomplished a keyway point along the
 

2125
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,840
accomplished a keyway point along the
way to his final goal that's a kind of

2126
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:17,850
way to his final goal that's a kind of
 

2127
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,490
way to his final goal that's a kind of
early symbolic cognition right to

2128
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:19,500
early symbolic cognition right to
 

2129
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,350
early symbolic cognition right to
understand that I'm trying to build a

2130
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:21,360
understand that I'm trying to build a
 

2131
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,360
understand that I'm trying to build a
tall tower but a tower is made up of

2132
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:23,370
tall tower but a tower is made up of
 

2133
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,920
tall tower but a tower is made up of
little towers it's you know it can end

2134
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:24,930
little towers it's you know it can end
 

2135
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,660
little towers it's you know it can end
and you can take a tower and put it on

2136
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:26,670
and you can take a tower and put it on
 

2137
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,190
and you can take a tower and put it on
top of another tower or stack a stack on

2138
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:28,200
top of another tower or stack a stack on
 

2139
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:28,490
top of another tower or stack a stack on
us

2140
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:28,500
us
 

2141
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,800
us
a can you have a bigger stack right so

2142
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:30,810
a can you have a bigger stack right so
 

2143
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:32,570
a can you have a bigger stack right so
think about how he goes from bottom up

2144
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:32,580
think about how he goes from bottom up
 

2145
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,520
think about how he goes from bottom up
perception to the objects of the physics

2146
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:34,530
perception to the objects of the physics
 

2147
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:35,870
perception to the objects of the physics
needed to manipulate the objects to the

2148
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:35,880
needed to manipulate the objects to the
 

2149
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,000
needed to manipulate the objects to the
ability to make even those early kinds

2150
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,010
ability to make even those early kinds
 

2151
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,490
ability to make even those early kinds
of symbolic plans at some point he keeps

2152
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:40,500
of symbolic plans at some point he keeps
 

2153
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,840
of symbolic plans at some point he keeps
doing this he puts another stack on

2154
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:41,850
doing this he puts another stack on
 

2155
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,990
doing this he puts another stack on
there I'll just jump to the end

2156
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:45,000
there I'll just jump to the end
 

2157
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,930
there I'll just jump to the end
oops sorry you missed it so he he gets

2158
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:47,940
oops sorry you missed it so he he gets
 

2159
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,000
oops sorry you missed it so he he gets
really excited and he gives himself

2160
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,010
really excited and he gives himself
 

2161
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,070
really excited and he gives himself
another big hand but falls over okay

2162
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:52,080
another big hand but falls over okay
 

2163
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,880
another big hand but falls over okay
again Boston Dynamics now has robots

2164
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:55,890
again Boston Dynamics now has robots
 

2165
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,380
again Boston Dynamics now has robots
that could pick themselves up after that

2166
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:57,390
that could pick themselves up after that
 

2167
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:00,080
that could pick themselves up after that
that's really impressive again but all

2168
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,090
that's really impressive again but all
 

2169
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,580
that's really impressive again but all
the other stuff to get to that point we

2170
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:01,590
the other stuff to get to that point we
 

2171
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,870
the other stuff to get to that point we
don't really know how to do in a robotic

2172
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:02,880
don't really know how to do in a robotic
 

2173
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,640
don't really know how to do in a robotic
setting or think about this baby here

2174
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:04,650
setting or think about this baby here
 

2175
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,590
setting or think about this baby here
this is a younger baby this is one of

2176
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:06,600
this is a younger baby this is one of
 

2177
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,540
this is a younger baby this is one of
the Internet's very most popular videos

2178
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:08,550
the Internet's very most popular videos
 

2179
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:12,400
the Internet's very most popular videos
because it features a baby and a cat and

2180
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:12,410
because it features a baby and a cat and
 

2181
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,300
because it features a baby and a cat and
but the babies doing something

2182
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:14,310
but the babies doing something
 

2183
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,190
but the babies doing something
interesting he's got the same cups but

2184
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:16,200
interesting he's got the same cups but
 

2185
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,830
interesting he's got the same cups but
he's decided he's again decided to try a

2186
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:18,840
he's decided he's again decided to try a
 

2187
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,570
he's decided he's again decided to try a
new thing so this think about creativity

2188
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:20,580
new thing so this think about creativity
 

2189
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,330
new thing so this think about creativity
he's decided that his goal is to stack

2190
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:23,340
he's decided that his goal is to stack
 

2191
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,520
he's decided that his goal is to stack
up cups on the back of a cat I guess

2192
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:25,530
up cups on the back of a cat I guess
 

2193
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,110
up cups on the back of a cat I guess
he's asking how many cups can I fit on

2194
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:27,120
he's asking how many cups can I fit on
 

2195
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,270
he's asking how many cups can I fit on
the back of a cat well three let's see

2196
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:29,280
the back of a cat well three let's see
 

2197
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,200
the back of a cat well three let's see
can I fit more let's try another one

2198
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,210
can I fit more let's try another one
 

2199
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:35,270
can I fit more let's try another one
okay well he can't fit more than three

2200
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:35,280
okay well he can't fit more than three
 

2201
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,550
okay well he can't fit more than three
it turns out and then he then does it's

2202
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:37,560
it turns out and then he then does it's
 

2203
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,410
it turns out and then he then does it's
not working so he changes his goal now

2204
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:39,420
not working so he changes his goal now
 

2205
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,150
not working so he changes his goal now
his goal appears to be to get the cups

2206
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:41,160
his goal appears to be to get the cups
 

2207
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,800
his goal appears to be to get the cups
on the other side of the cat now watch

2208
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:42,810
on the other side of the cat now watch
 

2209
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,390
on the other side of the cat now watch
that part when he reaches back behind

2210
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:44,400
that part when he reaches back behind
 

2211
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,950
that part when he reaches back behind
him there that's I'll just pause it

2212
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:45,960
him there that's I'll just pause it
 

2213
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,700
him there that's I'll just pause it
there for a moment

2214
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:46,710
there for a moment
 

2215
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,980
there for a moment
umm someone he just reached back there

2216
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:48,990
umm someone he just reached back there
 

2217
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,810
umm someone he just reached back there
that's a particularly striking moment in

2218
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:50,820
that's a particularly striking moment in
 

2219
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,240
that's a particularly striking moment in
the video it shows a very strong form of

2220
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:53,250
the video it shows a very strong form of
 

2221
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,970
the video it shows a very strong form of
what we call in cognitive science object

2222
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:55,980
what we call in cognitive science object
 

2223
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,370
what we call in cognitive science object
permanence okay that's the idea that you

2224
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:58,380
permanence okay that's the idea that you
 

2225
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,230
permanence okay that's the idea that you
represent objects as these permanent

2226
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:00,240
represent objects as these permanent
 

2227
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,000
represent objects as these permanent
enduring entities in the world even when

2228
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,010
enduring entities in the world even when
 

2229
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:04,010
enduring entities in the world even when
you can't see them in this case he

2230
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:04,020
you can't see them in this case he
 

2231
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,720
you can't see them in this case he
hadn't seen or touched that object

2232
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:05,730
hadn't seen or touched that object
 

2233
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:07,160
hadn't seen or touched that object
behind him for like at least a minute

2234
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:07,170
behind him for like at least a minute
 

2235
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,810
behind him for like at least a minute
right maybe much longer I don't know and

2236
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:08,820
right maybe much longer I don't know and
 

2237
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,700
right maybe much longer I don't know and
yet he still knew it was there and he

2238
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:10,710
yet he still knew it was there and he
 

2239
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,230
yet he still knew it was there and he
was able to incorporate it in his plan

2240
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:12,240
was able to incorporate it in his plan
 

2241
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,000
was able to incorporate it in his plan
right there's a moment before that when

2242
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,010
right there's a moment before that when
 

2243
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,200
right there's a moment before that when
he's about to reach for it but then he

2244
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:15,210
he's about to reach for it but then he
 

2245
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,790
he's about to reach for it but then he
sees this other one right and it's only

2246
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:16,800
sees this other one right and it's only
 

2247
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,170
sees this other one right and it's only
when he's now exhausted all the other

2248
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:18,180
when he's now exhausted all the other
 

2249
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,550
when he's now exhausted all the other
objects here that he can see he's like

2250
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:19,560
objects here that he can see he's like
 

2251
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,990
objects here that he can see he's like
okay now time to get this object and

2252
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:21,000
okay now time to get this object and
 

2253
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,450
okay now time to get this object and
bring it into play right so think about

2254
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:23,460
bring it into play right so think about
 

2255
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,850
bring it into play right so think about
what has to be going on in his brain for

2256
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:25,860
what has to be going on in his brain for
 

2257
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,560
what has to be going on in his brain for
him to be able to do that right that's

2258
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:27,570
him to be able to do that right that's
 

2259
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,120
him to be able to do that right that's
like the analog of you understanding

2260
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,130
like the analog of you understanding
 

2261
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,940
like the analog of you understanding
what's behind you okay um it's not that

2262
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:31,950
what's behind you okay um it's not that
 

2263
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,110
what's behind you okay um it's not that
these things are impossible to capture

2264
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:33,120
these things are impossible to capture
 

2265
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,910
these things are impossible to capture
machines far from it it's just that like

2266
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:34,920
machines far from it it's just that like
 

2267
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,650
machines far from it it's just that like
training a deep neural network or any

2268
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:36,660
training a deep neural network or any
 

2269
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,150
training a deep neural network or any
kind of pattern recognition system we

2270
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:38,160
kind of pattern recognition system we
 

2271
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,590
kind of pattern recognition system we
don't think is going to do it but we

2272
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:39,600
don't think is going to do it but we
 

2273
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,150
don't think is going to do it but we
think by reverse engineering how it

2274
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:41,160
think by reverse engineering how it
 

2275
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:41,940
think by reverse engineering how it
works in the brain

2276
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:41,950
works in the brain
 

2277
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,950
works in the brain
we might be able to do it I think we can

2278
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:43,960
we might be able to do it I think we can
 

2279
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,960
we might be able to do it I think we can
can do it okay it's not just humans that

2280
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:45,970
can do it okay it's not just humans that
 

2281
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:47,940
can do it okay it's not just humans that
do this kind of activity here's a couple

hey let me pause this one for a second
if we watch this orangutan here he's got

2296
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:04,210
if we watch this orangutan here he's got
 

2297
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:06,510
if we watch this orangutan here he's got
a bunch of big legos and over the course

2298
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:06,520
a bunch of big legos and over the course
 

2299
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,010
a bunch of big legos and over the course
of this video he's building up a stack

2300
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:10,020
of this video he's building up a stack
 

2301
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,680
of this video he's building up a stack
legos it's really quite impressive

2302
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:12,690
legos it's really quite impressive

you're just jumping to the end there's
 

2305
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,170
you're just jumping to the end there's
actually some controversy out there of

2306
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:19,180
actually some controversy out there of
 

2307
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,930
actually some controversy out there of
whether this video is a fake but the

2308
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:21,940
whether this video is a fake but the
 

2309
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,609
whether this video is a fake but the
controversy isn't about you know it's

00:38:23,609 --> 00:38:23,619
controversy isn't about you know it's
 

2311
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:25,380
controversy isn't about you know it's
not like whether it was I don't know

2312
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:25,390
not like whether it was I don't know
 

2313
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,750
not like whether it was I don't know
dumb with computer animation some people

2314
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:27,760
dumb with computer animation some people
 

2315
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,069
dumb with computer animation some people
think the video was actually filmed

2316
00:38:29,069 --> 00:38:29,079
think the video was actually filmed
 

2317
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:31,049
think the video was actually filmed
backwards that a human built up the

2318
00:38:31,049 --> 00:38:31,059
backwards that a human built up the
 

2319
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,640
backwards that a human built up the
stack and the orangutan just slowly

2320
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:32,650
stack and the orangutan just slowly
 

2321
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,289
stack and the orangutan just slowly
disassembled it piece by piece and it

2322
00:38:34,289 --> 00:38:34,299
disassembled it piece by piece and it
 

2323
00:38:34,299 --> 00:38:35,549
disassembled it piece by piece and it
turns out it's remarkably hard to tell

2324
00:38:35,549 --> 00:38:35,559
turns out it's remarkably hard to tell
 

2325
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:37,260
turns out it's remarkably hard to tell
whether it's played forward or backwards

2326
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:37,270
whether it's played forward or backwards
 

2327
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,640
whether it's played forward or backwards
in time and people have argued over

2328
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:38,650
in time and people have argued over
 

2329
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,170
in time and people have argued over
little details because you know it would

2330
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:40,180
little details because you know it would
 

2331
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,609
little details because you know it would
be quite impressive if an orangutan

2332
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:41,619
be quite impressive if an orangutan
 

2333
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,289
be quite impressive if an orangutan
actually was able to build up this

2334
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:43,299
actually was able to build up this
 

2335
00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:45,329
actually was able to build up this
really impressive stack of Legos but I

2336
00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:45,339
really impressive stack of Legos but I
 

2337
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:46,740
really impressive stack of Legos but I
would submit that it would be almost as

2338
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:46,750
would submit that it would be almost as
 

2339
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,809
would submit that it would be almost as
impressive if he disassembled it think

2340
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:48,819
impressive if he disassembled it think
 

2341
00:38:48,819 --> 00:38:50,549
impressive if he disassembled it think
about the activity I mean if I wanted to

2342
00:38:50,549 --> 00:38:50,559
about the activity I mean if I wanted to
 

2343
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:52,020
about the activity I mean if I wanted to
disassemble that the easiest thing to do

2344
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:52,030
disassemble that the easiest thing to do
 

2345
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,099
disassemble that the easiest thing to do
would just be to knock it over

2346
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:53,109
would just be to knock it over
 

2347
00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:54,690
would just be to knock it over
that's really all most robots could do

2348
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:54,700
that's really all most robots could do
 

2349
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,940
that's really all most robots could do
but to piece by piece disassemble it

2350
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:56,950
but to piece by piece disassemble it
 

2351
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,470
but to piece by piece disassemble it
even if it's played backwards like this

2352
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:58,480
even if it's played backwards like this
 

2353
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,900
even if it's played backwards like this
that's still a really impressive act of

2354
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:00,910
that's still a really impressive act of
 

2355
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:03,450
that's still a really impressive act of
symbolic planning on physical objects or

okay but again think what had to be

2404
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,010
okay but again think what had to be
 

2405
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:55,290
okay but again think what had to be
going on in his brain

going on in his brain
 

2407
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,480
going on in his brain
able to do that all right it's a crazy

2408
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:57,490
able to do that all right it's a crazy
 

2409
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,970
able to do that all right it's a crazy
thing and yet he formulated the goal and

2410
00:39:59,970 --> 00:39:59,980
thing and yet he formulated the goal and
 

2411
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,370
thing and yet he formulated the goal and
was able to achieve it I'll just show

2412
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:02,380
was able to achieve it I'll just show
 

2413
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,530
was able to achieve it I'll just show
one more video that is really more about

2414
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:04,540
one more video that is really more about
 

2415
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,060
one more video that is really more about
science these other ones are you know

2416
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:06,070
science these other ones are you know
 

2417
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,080
science these other ones are you know
some of them actually were from

2418
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,090
some of them actually were from
 

2419
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:09,090
some of them actually were from
scientific experiments but this is one

2420
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:09,100
scientific experiments but this is one
 

2421
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,100
scientific experiments but this is one
that motivates a lot of the science that

2422
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:11,110
that motivates a lot of the science that
 

2423
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,020
that motivates a lot of the science that
I do and it's to me it sets up kind of a

2424
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:13,030
I do and it's to me it sets up kind of a
 

2425
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,240
I do and it's to me it sets up kind of a
grand cognitive science challenge for AI

2426
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:15,250
grand cognitive science challenge for AI
 

2427
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,060
grand cognitive science challenge for AI
and robotics it's from an experiment

2428
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:18,070
and robotics it's from an experiment
 

2429
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,860
and robotics it's from an experiment
with humans again eighteen month olds or

2430
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:19,870
with humans again eighteen month olds or
 

2431
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,600
with humans again eighteen month olds or
one-and-a-half year old so the the kids

2432
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:21,610
one-and-a-half year old so the the kids
 

2433
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:22,980
one-and-a-half year old so the the kids
in this experiment were the same age is

00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:22,990
in this experiment were the same age is
 

2435
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,420
in this experiment were the same age is
the first baby I showed you the one who

00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:24,430
the first baby I showed you the one who
 

2437
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:26,430
the first baby I showed you the one who
did the stacking and 18 months is really

00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:26,440
did the stacking and 18 months is really
 

2439
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,920
did the stacking and 18 months is really
a very very good age to study if you're

2440
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:28,930
a very very good age to study if you're
 

2441
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,540
a very very good age to study if you're
interested in intelligence for reasons

helping behavior of young children it
 

2455
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,940
helping behavior of young children it
also contrasted humans and chimps and

2456
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:44,950
also contrasted humans and chimps and
 

2457
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,280
also contrasted humans and chimps and
the punchline is that chips sometimes do

2458
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:47,290
the punchline is that chips sometimes do
 

2459
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,390
the punchline is that chips sometimes do
things that are kind of like what this

00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:48,400
things that are kind of like what this
 

2461
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,940
things that are kind of like what this
human did but not nearly as reliably or

00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:50,950
human did but not nearly as reliably or
 

2463
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:53,610
human did but not nearly as reliably or
as flexibly okay so not nearly it is and

00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:53,620
as flexibly okay so not nearly it is and
 

2465
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,140
as flexibly okay so not nearly it is and
I'll show you a particular kind of

00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:55,150
I'll show you a particular kind of
 

2467
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:58,650
I'll show you a particular kind of
unusual situation where human kids had

unusual situation where human kids had
 

2469

unusual situation where human kids had
relatively little trouble figuring out

relatively little trouble figuring out
 

2471
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:01,920
relatively little trouble figuring out
kind of what to do or even whether they

2472
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:01,930
kind of what to do or even whether they
 

2473
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,840
kind of what to do or even whether they
should do it whereas basically no chimp

2474
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:03,850
should do it whereas basically no chimp
 

2475
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,580
should do it whereas basically no chimp

00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:19,060
the little kid in the corner there there
 

2487
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,500
the little kid in the corner there there
there's sound but no words right and at

2488
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:22,510
there's sound but no words right and at
 

2489
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,940
there's sound but no words right and at
some point he stops and then the kid

2490
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:23,950
some point he stops and then the kid
 

2491
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,680
some point he stops and then the kid
just does whatever they want to do so

2492
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:25,690
just does whatever they want to do so
 

2493
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,780
just does whatever they want to do so
watch what he does he goes over he opens

2494
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:27,790
watch what he does he goes over he opens
 

2495
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:31,170
watch what he does he goes over he opens
the cabinet looks inside then he steps

2496
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:31,180
the cabinet looks inside then he steps
 

2497
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:34,170
the cabinet looks inside then he steps
back and he looks up at felix and then

2498
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:34,180
back and he looks up at felix and then
 

2499
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,030
back and he looks up at felix and then
looks down okay and then the action is

2500
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:36,040
looks down okay and then the action is
 

2501
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,400
looks down okay and then the action is
completed now well wonder I want you to

2502
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:38,410
completed now well wonder I want you to
 

2503
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:39,750
completed now well wonder I want you to
watch it one more time and think about

2504
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:39,760
watch it one more time and think about
 

2505
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,580
watch it one more time and think about
what's gotta be going inside the kid's

2506
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:41,590
what's gotta be going inside the kid's
 

2507
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,590
what's gotta be going inside the kid's
head to understand this to understand

2508
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:43,600
head to understand this to understand
 

2509
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,510
head to understand this to understand
like so it seems like what it looks like

2510
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:45,520
like so it seems like what it looks like
 

2511
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,980
like so it seems like what it looks like
to us is the kid figured out that this

2512
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:46,990
to us is the kid figured out that this
 

2513
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,780
to us is the kid figured out that this
guy needed help and helped him and the

2514
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:48,790
guy needed help and helped him and the
 

2515
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,190
guy needed help and helped him and the
paper is full of many other situations

2516
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:50,200
paper is full of many other situations
 

2517
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,530
paper is full of many other situations
like this this is just one OK but the

2518
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:52,540
like this this is just one OK but the
 

2519
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,120
like this this is just one OK but the
key idea is that the situation is

2520
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:54,130
key idea is that the situation is
 

2521
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,190
key idea is that the situation is
somewhat novel people have seen people

2522
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:56,200
somewhat novel people have seen people
 

2523
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,840
somewhat novel people have seen people
holding books and opening cabinets but

2524
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:57,850
holding books and opening cabinets but
 

2525
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:00,120
holding books and opening cabinets but
probably it's very rare to see this kind

2526
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,130
probably it's very rare to see this kind
 

2527
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:01,950
probably it's very rare to see this kind
of situation exactly right it's

2528
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:01,960
of situation exactly right it's
 

2529
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,810
of situation exactly right it's
different in some important details from

2530
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:03,820
different in some important details from
 

2531
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,980
different in some important details from
what you might have seen before and

2532
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:04,990
what you might have seen before and
 

2533
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:05,940
what you might have seen before and
there's other ones in there that are

2534
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:05,950
there's other ones in there that are
 

2535
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,080
there's other ones in there that are
really truly novel because they just

2536
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:07,090
really truly novel because they just
 

2537
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:08,230
really truly novel because they just
made up a machine right there

2538
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:08,240
made up a machine right there
 

2539
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,290
made up a machine right there
okay but somehow he has to understand

2540
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:11,300
okay but somehow he has to understand
 

2541
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,390
okay but somehow he has to understand
causally from the way the guy's banging

00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:13,400
causally from the way the guy's banging
 

2543
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,859
causally from the way the guy's banging
the books against the thing that it's

2544
00:42:14,859 --> 00:42:14,869
the books against the thing that it's
 

2545
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:16,720
the books against the thing that it's
it's sort it's sort of both a symbol but

2546
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:16,730
it's sort it's sort of both a symbol but
 

2547
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:18,460
it's sort it's sort of both a symbol but
it's also somehow he's got to understand

2548
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:18,470
it's also somehow he's got to understand
 

2549
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:20,380
it's also somehow he's got to understand
what he can do and what he can't do and

2550
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:20,390
what he can do and what he can't do and
 

2551
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,839
what he can do and what he can't do and
then what the kid can do to help and

2552
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:22,849
then what the kid can do to help and
 

2553
00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:24,820
then what the kid can do to help and
I'll show this again but really just

2554
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:24,830
I'll show this again but really just
 

2555
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:29,880
I'll show this again but really just
watch the main part I want you to see is

2556
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:29,890
watch the main part I want you to see is
 

2557
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:34,540
watch the main part I want you to see is
I'll just sort of skip ahead so watch

2558
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:34,550
I'll just sort of skip ahead so watch
 

2559
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:37,240
I'll just sort of skip ahead so watch
this part here let's say I'll just jump

2560
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:37,250
this part here let's say I'll just jump
 

2561
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,460
this part here let's say I'll just jump
right when he watch right now he's about

2562
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:39,470
right when he watch right now he's about
 

2563
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,349
right when he watch right now he's about
to look up he looks up and makes eye

2564
00:42:41,349 --> 00:42:41,359
to look up he looks up and makes eye
 

2565
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,990
to look up he looks up and makes eye
contact and then his eyes look down so

2566
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:44,000
contact and then his eyes look down so
 

2567
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,640
contact and then his eyes look down so
again he looks up he looks up and then a

2568
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:48,650
again he looks up he looks up and then a
 

2569
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,770
again he looks up he looks up and then a
saccade a sudden rapid eye movement down

2570
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:50,780
saccade a sudden rapid eye movement down
 

2571
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:53,440
saccade a sudden rapid eye movement down
down to his hands up down okay so that's

2572
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:53,450
down to his hands up down okay so that's
 

2573
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:55,810
down to his hands up down okay so that's
again that's this brain OS in action

2574
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:55,820
again that's this brain OS in action
 

2575
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,150
again that's this brain OS in action
right he's making one glance small

2576
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:58,160
right he's making one glance small
 

2577
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,060
right he's making one glance small
glance at the big guy's eyes just to

2578
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:01,070
glance at the big guy's eyes just to
 

2579
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:03,460
glance at the big guy's eyes just to
make eye contact to see to get a signal

2580
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:03,470
make eye contact to see to get a signal
 

2581
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:06,339
make eye contact to see to get a signal
did I understand what you wanted and did

2582
00:43:06,339 --> 00:43:06,349
did I understand what you wanted and did
 

2583
00:43:06,349 --> 00:43:07,900
did I understand what you wanted and did
you did you register that joint

2584
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:07,910
you did you register that joint
 

2585
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:10,180
you did you register that joint
attention and then he makes a prediction

2586
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:10,190
attention and then he makes a prediction
 

2587
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:11,770
attention and then he makes a prediction
about what the guy's gonna do so he

2588
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:11,780
about what the guy's gonna do so he
 

2589
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,089
about what the guy's gonna do so he
looks right down he doesn't just like

2590
00:43:13,089 --> 00:43:13,099
looks right down he doesn't just like
 

2591
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:14,740
looks right down he doesn't just like
look around randomly he looks right down

2592
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:14,750
look around randomly he looks right down
 

2593
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,440
look around randomly he looks right down
to the guy's hands to track the action

2594
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:17,450
to the guy's hands to track the action
 

2595
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:19,630
to the guy's hands to track the action
that he expects to see happening if I

2596
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:19,640
that he expects to see happening if I
 

2597
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,770
that he expects to see happening if I
did the right thing to help you then I

2598
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:20,780
did the right thing to help you then I
 

2599
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,150
did the right thing to help you then I
expect you're gonna put the books there

2600
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:22,160
expect you're gonna put the books there
 

2601
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,280
expect you're gonna put the books there
okay so you can see these things

2602
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:24,290
okay so you can see these things
 

2603
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:25,660
okay so you can see these things
happening and we want to know what's

2604
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:25,670
happening and we want to know what's
 

2605
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,339
happening and we want to know what's
going on inside the mind that guides all

2606
00:43:27,339 --> 00:43:27,349
going on inside the mind that guides all
 

2607
00:43:27,349 --> 00:43:29,859
going on inside the mind that guides all
of that all right so that's the sort of

2608
00:43:29,859 --> 00:43:29,869
of that all right so that's the sort of
 

2609
00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:31,660
of that all right so that's the sort of
big scientific agenda that we're working

2610
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:31,670
big scientific agenda that we're working
 

2611
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,430
big scientific agenda that we're working
on over the next few years where we

2612
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:33,440
on over the next few years where we
 

2613
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,920
on over the next few years where we
think some kind of human understanding

2614
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:35,930
think some kind of human understanding
 

2615
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:38,260
think some kind of human understanding
of human intelligence in scientific

2616
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:38,270
of human intelligence in scientific
 

2617
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:40,510
of human intelligence in scientific
terms could lead to all sorts of AI

2618
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:40,520
terms could lead to all sorts of AI
 

2619
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,910
terms could lead to all sorts of AI
payoffs in particular suppose we could

2620
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:42,920
payoffs in particular suppose we could
 

2621
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,260
payoffs in particular suppose we could
build a robot that could do what this

2622
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:44,270
build a robot that could do what this
 

2623
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:45,460
build a robot that could do what this
kid and many other kids and these

2624
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,470
kid and many other kids and these
 

2625
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,200
kid and many other kids and these
experiments do just say help you out

2626
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:47,210
experiments do just say help you out
 

2627
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:48,670
experiments do just say help you out
around the house without having to be

2628
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:48,680
around the house without having to be
 

2629
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,260
around the house without having to be
programmed or even really instructed

2630
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:50,270
programmed or even really instructed
 

2631
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:52,599
programmed or even really instructed
just to kind of get a sense oh yeah you

2632
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:52,609
just to kind of get a sense oh yeah you
 

2633
00:43:52,609 --> 00:43:53,800
just to kind of get a sense oh yeah you
need to have at that shirt let me help

2634
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:53,810
need to have at that shirt let me help
 

2635
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:56,290
need to have at that shirt let me help
you out okay even 18 month olds will do

2636
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:56,300
you out okay even 18 month olds will do
 

2637
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,060
you out okay even 18 month olds will do

um what is the idea of a probabilistic

2678
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:38,400
um what is the idea of a probabilistic
 

2679
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,800
um what is the idea of a probabilistic
program so this is a kind of a you think

2680
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:42,810
program so this is a kind of a you think
 

2681
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:45,860
program so this is a kind of a you think
of it as a computational abstraction

2682
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:45,870
of it as a computational abstraction
 

2683
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:47,450
of it as a computational abstraction
that we can use to capture the

2689
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,100

directed graphical models if you know
 

2705
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:08,510

those okay but where instead of defining

00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:08,520
those okay but where instead of defining
 

2707
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,660
those okay but where instead of defining
a probability model on a graph you

00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:11,670
a probability model on a graph you
 

2709
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:15,230
a probability model on a graph you
define it on a program and thereby have

2710
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:15,240
define it on a program and thereby have
 

2711
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,080
define it on a program and thereby have
access to a much more expressive toolkit

2712

00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:23,730
tools for representing knowledge okay
 

2719
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,910
tools for representing knowledge okay
but you still have access to the ability

2720
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:25,920
but you still have access to the ability
 

2721
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,920
but you still have access to the ability
to do probabilistic inference like in a

2722
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:27,930
to do probabilistic inference like in a

so for those of you who know about

2728
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:33,360
so for those of you who know about
 

2729
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,030
so for those of you who know about
graphical models that might make some

2730
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:35,040
graphical models that might make some
 

2731
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,800
graphical models that might make some
sense to you but just more broadly what

2732
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:36,810
sense to you but just more broadly what
 

2733
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:38,660
sense to you but just more broadly what
this is think of this as as a toolkit

2734
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:38,670
this is think of this as as a toolkit
 

2735
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,730
this is think of this as as a toolkit
that allows us to combine several of the

2736
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:40,740
that allows us to combine several of the
 

2737
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,160
that allows us to combine several of the
best ideas not just of the recent deep

best ideas not just of the recent deep
 

2739
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:44,720
best ideas not just of the recent deep
learning era but over if you look back

2740
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:44,730
learning era but over if you look back
 

2741
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:46,820
learning era but over if you look back
over the whole scope of AI and as well

2742
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:46,830
over the whole scope of AI and as well
 

2743
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,620
over the whole scope of AI and as well
as cognitive science I think there's

2744
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:48,630
as cognitive science I think there's
 

2745
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:51,440
as cognitive science I think there's
three or four ideas there and more but

2746
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:51,450
three or four ideas there and more but
 

2747
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:52,790
three or four ideas there and more but
definitely like three ideas we could

2748
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:52,800
definitely like three ideas we could
 

2749
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,920
definitely like three ideas we could
really put up there that have proven

2750
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:54,930
really put up there that have proven
 

2751
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:56,840
really put up there that have proven
their worth and have have had have risen

2752
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:56,850
their worth and have have had have risen
 

2753
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:58,880
their worth and have have had have risen
and fallen in terms of each of these had

2754
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:58,890
and fallen in terms of each of these had
 

2755
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:00,770
and fallen in terms of each of these had
ideas when the mainstream of the field

2756
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:00,780
ideas when the mainstream of the field
 

2757
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,090
ideas when the mainstream of the field
thought this was totally the way to go

2758
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:02,100
thought this was totally the way to go
 

2759
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,980
thought this was totally the way to go
and every other idea was was obviously a

2760
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:03,990
and every other idea was was obviously a
 

2761
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:06,950
and every other idea was was obviously a
waste of time and also had its time when

2762
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:06,960
waste of time and also had its time when
 

2763
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,390
waste of time and also had its time when
many people thought it was a waste of

many people thought it was a waste of
 

2765
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,520
many people thought it was a waste of
time okay and these three big ideas I

2766
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:10,530
time okay and these three big ideas I
 

2767
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:12,110
time okay and these three big ideas I
would say are first of all the idea of

00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,010
and I think again many people are using
some version of this idea but maybe a

2956
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:16,020
some version of this idea but maybe a
 

2957
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,930
some version of this idea but maybe a
little bit different from the way we're

2958
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:17,940
little bit different from the way we're
 

2959
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:20,540
little bit different from the way we're
doing it is what what version of this

2960
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:20,550
doing it is what what version of this
 

2961
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:22,280
doing it is what what version of this
idea that I'd like to talk about is what

2962
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:22,290
idea that I'd like to talk about is what
 

2963
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:24,530
idea that I'd like to talk about is what
I call the game engine in the head so

2964
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:24,540
I call the game engine in the head so
 

2965
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,930
I call the game engine in the head so
this is the idea that it's really what

2966
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:26,940
this is the idea that it's really what
 

2967
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:28,430
this is the idea that it's really what
the programs are about when I talk about

2968
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:28,440
the programs are about when I talk about
 

2969
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,230
the programs are about when I talk about
problems tick programs I haven't said

2970
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:30,240
problems tick programs I haven't said
 

2971
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,550
problems tick programs I haven't said
anything about what kind of programs

2972
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:31,560
anything about what kind of programs
 

2973
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,990
anything about what kind of programs
we're using we're just basically these

2974
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:33,000
we're using we're just basically these
 

2975
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,700
we're using we're just basically these
probablistic programming languages at

2976
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:34,710
probablistic programming languages at

2987
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:46,160
be a turing-complete probabilistic

computable you could represent in these

00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:02,970
very inspired in the last few years by
 

3005
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:04,460
very inspired in the last few years by
thinking about the kinds of programs

3006
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:04,470
thinking about the kinds of programs
 

3007
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:07,070
thinking about the kinds of programs
that are in modern video game engines so

3008
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:07,080
that are in modern video game engines so
 

3009
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,270
that are in modern video game engines so
again I'm probably most of you are

3010
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:08,280
again I'm probably most of you are
 

3011
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,040
again I'm probably most of you are
familiar with these but if you're and

3012
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:10,050
familiar with these but if you're and
 

3013
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,510
familiar with these but if you're and
increasingly they're playing a role in

3014
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:11,520
increasingly they're playing a role in
 

3015
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,980
increasingly they're playing a role in
all sorts of ways an AI but these are

have an AI in the game that is like

3095
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:31,910
kid you know the guards would just be
like random things that would fire

3096
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:31,920
like random things that would fire
 

3097

3101
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:36,650

let's say you want a guard to be a
little intelligent so to actually look

3104
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:38,670
little intelligent so to actually look
 

3105
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:40,309
little intelligent so to actually look
around him oh and I see the player and

around him oh and I see the player and
 

3107
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:41,660
around him oh and I see the player and
then to actually start shooting at you

3108
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:41,670
then to actually start shooting at you
 

3109
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:43,609
then to actually start shooting at you
and to even maybe pursue you so that

3267
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:20,680
the floor so you tell me is it more
likely to be red blocks or yellow blocks

3268
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:20,690
likely to be red blocks or yellow blocks
 

3269
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:23,550
likely to be red blocks or yellow blocks
what do you say red okay good

3270
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:23,560
what do you say red okay good
 

3271
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:28,000
what do you say red okay good
how about here yellow good how about

3272
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:28,010
how about here yellow good how about
 

3273
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:40,990
how about here yellow good how about
here uh-huh here here okay here here

3274
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:41,000
here uh-huh here here okay here here
 

3275
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,510
here uh-huh here here okay here here
okay so

3276
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:43,520
okay so
 

3277
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,830
okay so
you just experience for yourself what

3278
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:44,840
you just experience for yourself what
 

3279
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,570
you just experience for yourself what
it's like to be an objective one of

3280
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:46,580
it's like to be an objective one of
 

3281
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:47,500
it's like to be an objective one of
these experience we just did the

3282
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:47,510
these experience we just did the
 

3283
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:49,030
these experience we just did the
experiment here the data is all captured

3284
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:49,040
experiment here the data is all captured
 

3285
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,460
experiment here the data is all captured
on video sort of right okay you could

3286
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:51,470
on video sort of right okay you could
 

3287
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:54,400
on video sort of right okay you could
see that sometimes people were very

3288
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:54,410
see that sometimes people were very
 

3289
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:55,720
see that sometimes people were very
quick other times people were slower

3290
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:55,730
quick other times people were slower
 

3291
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:57,760
quick other times people were slower
sometimes there was a lot of consensus

3292
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:57,770
sometimes there was a lot of consensus
 

3293
00:54:57,770 --> 00:54:58,900
sometimes there was a lot of consensus
sometimes there was a little bit less

3294
00:54:58,900 --> 00:54:58,910
sometimes there was a little bit less
 

3295
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:00,100
sometimes there was a little bit less
consensus right

3296
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:00,110
consensus right
 

3297
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:01,840
consensus right
that reflects uncertainty so again

3298
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:01,850
that reflects uncertainty so again
 

3299
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:03,220
that reflects uncertainty so again
there's a long history of studying this

3300
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:03,230
there's a long history of studying this
 

3301
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:06,250
there's a long history of studying this
scientifically that you know you could

3302
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:06,260
scientifically that you know you could
 

3303
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:08,380
scientifically that you know you could
but you can see something you can see

3304
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:08,390
but you can see something you can see
 

3305
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:09,820
but you can see something you can see
the probabilistic inference at work

3306
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:09,830
the probabilistic inference at work
 

3307
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:12,070

probabilistic inference over what well I

3308
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:12,080
probabilistic inference over what well I
 

3309
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,560
probabilistic inference over what well I
would say one way to describe it is over

3310
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:14,570
would say one way to describe it is over
 

3311
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:16,750
would say one way to describe it is over
one or a few short low precision

3312
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:16,760
one or a few short low precision
 

3313
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,550
one or a few short low precision
simulations of the physics of these

3314
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:18,560
simulations of the physics of these
 

3315
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,320
simulations of the physics of these
scenes so here is what I mean by this

3316
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:20,330

3322
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:26,960
scenes that simulates a small bump so
 

3323
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,050
scenes that simulates a small bump so
here's a small bubble here's the same

3324
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:29,060
here's a small bubble here's the same
 

3325
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,240
here's a small bubble here's the same
scene with a big bump okay now notice

3326
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:31,250
scene with a big bump okay now notice
 

3327
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:33,250
scene with a big bump okay now notice
that at the micro level different things

3328
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:33,260
that at the micro level different things
 

3329
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,830
that at the micro level different things
happen but at the cognitive or macro

3330
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:35,840
happen but at the cognitive or macro
 

3331
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,180
happen but at the cognitive or macro
level that matters for common sense

level that matters for common sense
 

3333
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:38,890
level that matters for common sense
reasoning the same thing happened namely

3334
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:38,900
reasoning the same thing happened namely
 

3335
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,450
reasoning the same thing happened namely
all the yellow blocks went over onto one

3336
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:40,460
all the yellow blocks went over onto one
 

3337
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,400
all the yellow blocks went over onto one
side of the table and few or none of the

3338
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:42,410
side of the table and few or none of the
 

3339
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:44,590
side of the table and few or none of the
red blocks did so it didn't matter reach

3340
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:44,600
red blocks did so it didn't matter reach
 

3341
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,760
red blocks did so it didn't matter reach
of those simulations you ran in your

3342
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:45,770
of those simulations you ran in your
 

3343
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:47,110
of those simulations you ran in your
head you'd get the same answer in this

3344
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:47,120
head you'd get the same answer in this
 

3345
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,550
head you'd get the same answer in this
case right this is one that's very easy

3346
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:48,560
case right this is one that's very easy
 

3347
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,100
case right this is one that's very easy
and high confidence and quick also you

3348
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:51,110
and high confidence and quick also you
 

3349
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:52,510
and high confidence and quick also you
didn't have to run the simulation for

3350
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:52,520
didn't have to run the simulation for
 

3351
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,040
didn't have to run the simulation for
very long you only have to run it for a

3352
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:54,050
very long you only have to run it for a
 

3353
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:55,840
very long you only have to run it for a
few time steps like that to see what's

3354
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:55,850
few time steps like that to see what's
 

3355
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:57,220
few time steps like that to see what's
gonna happen or similarly here you only

3356
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:57,230
gonna happen or similarly here you only
 

3357
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:59,110
gonna happen or similarly here you only
have to run it for a few time steps okay

3358
00:55:59,110 --> 00:55:59,120
have to run it for a few time steps okay
 

3359
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,310
have to run it for a few time steps okay
and it doesn't have to be even very

3360
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:00,320
and it doesn't have to be even very
 

3361
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,170
and it doesn't have to be even very
accurate even a fair amount of

3362
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:02,180
accurate even a fair amount of
 

3363
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,210
accurate even a fair amount of
imprecision will give you basically the

3364
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:04,220
imprecision will give you basically the
 

3365
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:05,710
imprecision will give you basically the
same answer at the level that matters

3366
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:05,720
same answer at the level that matters
 

3367
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,540
same answer at the level that matters
for common sense so that's the kind of

3368
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:07,550
for common sense so that's the kind of
 

3369
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:09,640
for common sense so that's the kind of
thing our model does it runs a few low

3370
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:09,650
thing our model does it runs a few low
 

3371
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:11,320
thing our model does it runs a few low
precision simulations for a few time

3372
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:11,330
precision simulations for a few time
 

3373
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:13,060
precision simulations for a few time
steps but if you take the average of

3374
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:13,070
steps but if you take the average of
 

3375
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:14,830
steps but if you take the average of
what happens there and you compare that

3376
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:14,840
what happens there and you compare that
 

3377
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,360
what happens there and you compare that
with people's judgments you get results

3378
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:16,370
with people's judgments you get results
 

3379
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:17,860
with people's judgments you get results
like what I show you here the

3380
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:17,870
like what I show you here the
 

3381
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:20,290
like what I show you here the
scatterplot shows on the y-axis the

model and it does a pretty good job it's
 

3389
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:26,800
model and it does a pretty good job it's
not perfect but the model basically

3390
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:26,810
not perfect but the model basically
 

3391
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:28,900
not perfect but the model basically

00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:34,090
going on in this scene and many of these
others okay and it doesn't do it with

others okay and it doesn't do it with
 

3397
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,680
others okay and it doesn't do it with
any learning but I'll come back to that

and the question is basically how much
 

3565
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:16,830
and the question is basically how much
does the agent want the goal that it

that uses like the least energy to get
 

3721
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,580
that uses like the least energy to get
to that object and then we can do a

probabilistic inference part the program
 

3727
01:01:56,410 --> 01:01:59,430
probabilistic inference part the program
is them is the MU Joker planner okay but

is them is the MU Joker planner okay but
 

3729
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,740
is them is the MU Joker planner okay but
then we can say I want to do Bayesian

3730
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:01,750
then we can say I want to do Bayesian
 

3731
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:03,540
then we can say I want to do Bayesian

01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:05,200
observed which was the action to the
 

3735
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,350
observed which was the action to the
input to that program what goal was

3736
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:07,360
input to that program what goal was
 

3737
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,820
input to that program what goal was
provided as input to the planner and

3738
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:08,830
provided as input to the planner and
 

3739
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:11,310
provided as input to the planner and
here you can see the full array of four

3740
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:11,320
here you can see the full array of four
 

3741
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,500
here you can see the full array of four
by four possible inputs and those bars

3742
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:13,510
by four possible inputs and those bars
 

3743
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:14,760
by four possible inputs and those bars
that are moving up and down that's the

3744
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:14,770
that are moving up and down that's the
 

3745
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:16,860
that are moving up and down that's the
Bayesian posterior probability of how

3746
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:16,870
Bayesian posterior probability of how
 

3747
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:18,870
Bayesian posterior probability of how
likely each of those was to be the goal

3748
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:18,880
likely each of those was to be the goal
 

3749
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,030
likely each of those was to be the goal
and what you can see is it converges on

3750
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:21,040
and what you can see is it converges on
 

3751
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,710
and what you can see is it converges on
the right answer at least well it turns

3752
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:22,720
the right answer at least well it turns
 

3753
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,180
the right answer at least well it turns
out to be the ground truth right answer

3754
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:24,190
out to be the ground truth right answer
 

3755
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:25,380
out to be the ground truth right answer
but it's also the right answer according

3756
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:25,390
but it's also the right answer according
 

3757
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:27,330
but it's also the right answer according
to what people think with about the same

3758
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:27,340
to what people think with about the same
 

3759
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:30,240
to what people think with about the same
kind of data that people took now you

3760
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:30,250
kind of data that people took now you
 

3761
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:32,310
kind of data that people took now you
might say well okay I'm sure if I just

3762
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:32,320
might say well okay I'm sure if I just
 

3763
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,540
might say well okay I'm sure if I just
wanted to build a system that could

3764
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:33,550
wanted to build a system that could
 

3765
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:34,950
wanted to build a system that could
detect what somebody was reaching for I

3766
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:34,960
detect what somebody was reaching for I
 

3767
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,960
detect what somebody was reaching for I
could generate a training data set of

3768
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:36,970
could generate a training data set of
 

3769
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:39,300
could generate a training data set of
this sort of scene and train something

3770
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:39,310
this sort of scene and train something
 

3771
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:41,520
this sort of scene and train something
up to analyze patterns of motion but

3772
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:41,530
up to analyze patterns of motion but
 

3773
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:43,440
up to analyze patterns of motion but
again because the engine in your head

01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:43,450
again because the engine in your head
 

3775
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:44,790
again because the engine in your head
actually does something we think more

3776
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:44,800
actually does something we think more
 

3777
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,800
actually does something we think more
like this it does what we call inverse

3778
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:46,810
like this it does what we call inverse
 

3779
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:48,870
like this it does what we call inverse
planning over a physics model it can

3780
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:48,880
planning over a physics model it can
 

3781
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,760
planning over a physics model it can
apply to much more interesting scenes

3782
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:50,770
apply to much more interesting scenes
 

3783
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:51,930
apply to much more interesting scenes
that you haven't really seen much of

3784
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:51,940
that you haven't really seen much of
 

3785
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:53,700
that you haven't really seen much of
before so take the scene on the left

3786
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:53,710
before so take the scene on the left
 

3787
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:55,380
before so take the scene on the left
right where again you see somebody

3788
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:55,390
right where again you see somebody
 

3789
01:02:55,390 --> 01:02:57,060
right where again you see somebody
reaching for one of a four by four array

3790
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:57,070
reaching for one of a four by four array
 

3791
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:59,160
reaching for one of a four by four array
of objects but what you see is a strange

3792
01:02:59,160 --> 01:02:59,170
of objects but what you see is a strange
 

3793
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:00,960
of objects but what you see is a strange
kind of reach can you see why he's doing

3794
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:00,970
kind of reach can you see why he's doing
 

3795
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:03,630
kind of reach can you see why he's doing
that strange reach up there it's a

3796
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:03,640
that strange reach up there it's a
 

3797
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,460
that strange reach up there it's a
little small but what is you can see

3798
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:05,470
little small but what is you can see
 

3799
01:03:05,470 --> 01:03:07,440
little small but what is you can see
that he's reaching over something right

3800
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:07,450
that he's reaching over something right
 

3801
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,270
that he's reaching over something right
it's actually a pane of glass right you

3802
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:09,280
it's actually a pane of glass right you
 

3803
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,610
it's actually a pane of glass right you
see that and then there's this other guy

3804
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:11,620
see that and then there's this other guy
 

3805
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:14,610
see that and then there's this other guy
who's helping him who sees what he wants

3806
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:14,620
who's helping him who sees what he wants
 

3807
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:15,220
who's helping him who sees what he wants
and hands

3808
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:15,230
and hands
 

3809
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:17,710
and hands
the thing he wants so how does the firt

3810
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:17,720
the thing he wants so how does the firt
 

3811
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,359
the thing he wants so how does the firt
the guy in the foreground see the other

3812
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:19,369
the guy in the foreground see the other
 

3813
01:03:19,369 --> 01:03:20,140
the guy in the foreground see the other
guy's goal

3814
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:20,150
guy's goal
 

3815
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:22,359
guy's goal
how does he and for his goal and know

3816
01:03:22,359 --> 01:03:22,369
how does he and for his goal and know
 

3817
01:03:22,369 --> 01:03:24,010
how does he and for his goal and know
how to help him and then how do we look

3818
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:24,020
how to help him and then how do we look
 

3819
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:25,359
how to help him and then how do we look
at the two of them and figure out who's

3820
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:25,369
at the two of them and figure out who's
 

3821
01:03:25,369 --> 01:03:27,310
at the two of them and figure out who's
trying to help who or that in a scene

3822
01:03:27,310 --> 01:03:27,320
trying to help who or that in a scene
 

3823
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,470
trying to help who or that in a scene
like this one here that it's not

3824
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:29,480
like this one here that it's not
 

3825
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:30,880
like this one here that it's not
somebody trying to help somebody but

3826
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:30,890
somebody trying to help somebody but
 

3827
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:31,750
somebody trying to help somebody but
rather the opposite

3828
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:31,760
rather the opposite
 

3829
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,210
rather the opposite
okay so here's a model on the left of

3830
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:34,220
okay so here's a model on the left of
 

3831
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:35,590
okay so here's a model on the left of
how that might work right and we think

3832
01:03:35,590 --> 01:03:35,600
how that might work right and we think
 

3833
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:36,940
how that might work right and we think
this is the kind of model needed to

3834
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:36,950
this is the kind of model needed to
 

3835
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:38,830
this is the kind of model needed to
tackle this sort of challenge here right

3836
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:38,840
tackle this sort of challenge here right
 

3837
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:41,140
tackle this sort of challenge here right
basically it's a model it's a we take

3838
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:41,150
basically it's a model it's a we take
 

3839
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,359
basically it's a model it's a we take
this model of planning sort of maximal

3840
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:43,369
this model of planning sort of maximal
 

3841
01:03:43,369 --> 01:03:45,460
this model of planning sort of maximal
expected utility planning which you can

3842
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:45,470
expected utility planning which you can
 

3843
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:46,930
expected utility planning which you can
run backwards but then we recursively

3844
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:46,940
run backwards but then we recursively
 

3845
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:49,090
run backwards but then we recursively
nest these models inside each other so

3846
01:03:49,090 --> 01:03:49,100
nest these models inside each other so
 

3847
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,160
nest these models inside each other so
we say an agent is helping another agent

3848
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:51,170
we say an agent is helping another agent
 

3849
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:53,770
we say an agent is helping another agent
if this agent is acting apparently to us

3850
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:53,780
if this agent is acting apparently to us
 

3851
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:55,720
if this agent is acting apparently to us
seems to be maximizing an expected

3852
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:55,730
seems to be maximizing an expected
 

3853
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:58,780
seems to be maximizing an expected
utility that's a positive function of

3854
01:03:58,780 --> 01:03:58,790
utility that's a positive function of
 

3855
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:00,400
utility that's a positive function of
that agents expectation about another

3856
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:00,410
that agents expectation about another
 

3857
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:01,930
that agents expectation about another
agents expected utility and that's what

3858
01:04:01,930 --> 01:04:01,940
agents expected utility and that's what
 

3859
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:04,270
agents expected utility and that's what
it means to be a helper hindering is

3860
01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:04,280
it means to be a helper hindering is
 

3861
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,950
it means to be a helper hindering is
sort of the opposite if one seems to be

3862
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:05,960
sort of the opposite if one seems to be
 

3863
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,050
sort of the opposite if one seems to be
trying to lower somebody else's utility

3864
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:08,060
trying to lower somebody else's utility
 

3865
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:10,480
trying to lower somebody else's utility
okay and we've used these same kind of

3866
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:10,490
okay and we've used these same kind of
 

3867
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:12,550
okay and we've used these same kind of
models to also describe infants

3868
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:12,560
models to also describe infants
 

3869
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:13,690
models to also describe infants
understanding of helping and hindering

3870
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:13,700
understanding of helping and hindering
 

3871
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:16,960
understanding of helping and hindering
in a range of scenes I'll just say one

3872
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:16,970
in a range of scenes I'll just say one
 

3873
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:18,250
in a range of scenes I'll just say one
last word about learning because

3874
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:18,260
last word about learning because
 

3875
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:19,450
last word about learning because
everybody wants to know about learning

3876
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:19,460
everybody wants to know about learning
 

3877
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:22,120
everybody wants to know about learning
and and the the key thing here and it's

3878
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:22,130
and and the the key thing here and it's
 

3879
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:24,190
and and the the key thing here and it's
definitely part of any picture of AGI

3880
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:24,200
definitely part of any picture of AGI
 

3881
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,349
definitely part of any picture of AGI
but the thought I want to leave you on

3882
01:04:26,349 --> 01:04:26,359
but the thought I want to leave you on
 

3883
01:04:26,359 --> 01:04:27,640
but the thought I want to leave you on
is really about what learning is about

3884
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:27,650
is really about what learning is about
 

3885
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:29,230
is really about what learning is about
ok I'll be just a few more slides and

3886
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:29,240
ok I'll be just a few more slides and
 

3887
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,990
ok I'll be just a few more slides and
then I'll stop I promise none of the

01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:32,000
then I'll stop I promise none of the
 

3889
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,520
then I'll stop I promise none of the
models I showed you so far really did

3890
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:33,530
models I showed you so far really did
 

3891
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:34,780
models I showed you so far really did
any learning they certainly didn't do

3892
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:34,790
any learning they certainly didn't do
 

3893
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:37,330
any learning they certainly didn't do
any task specific learning ok we set up

3894
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:37,340
any task specific learning ok we set up
 

3895
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,770
any task specific learning ok we set up
a probable state program and then we let

3896
01:04:38,770 --> 01:04:38,780
a probable state program and then we let
 

3897
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:40,570
a probable state program and then we let
it to inference now that's not to say

3898
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:40,580
it to inference now that's not to say
 

3899
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:41,920
it to inference now that's not to say
that we don't think people learn to do

3900
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:41,930
that we don't think people learn to do
 

3901
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:43,870
that we don't think people learn to do
these things we do but the real learning

3902
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:43,880
these things we do but the real learning
 

3903
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,120
these things we do but the real learning
goes on when you're much younger right

3904
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:46,130
goes on when you're much younger right
 

3905
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:48,070
goes on when you're much younger right
everything I showed you in basic form

3906
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:48,080
everything I showed you in basic form
 

3907
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,710
everything I showed you in basic form
even a one-year-old baby can do ok the

3908
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:50,720
even a one-year-old baby can do ok the
 

3909
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,109
even a one-year-old baby can do ok the
basic learning goes on to support these

3910
01:04:53,109 --> 01:04:53,119
basic learning goes on to support these
 

3911
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:54,490
basic learning goes on to support these
kinds of abilities not that there isn't

01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:54,500
kinds of abilities not that there isn't
 

3913
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,470
kinds of abilities not that there isn't
learning beyond one year but the basic

3914
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:56,480
learning beyond one year but the basic
 

3915
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,150
learning beyond one year but the basic
way you learn to say solve these physics

3916
01:04:58,150 --> 01:04:58,160
way you learn to say solve these physics
 

3917
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,430

summarizing in very broad strokes with
 

3941
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:22,390
summarizing in very broad strokes with
big error bars what we've learned in the

about when and how kids seem to have to

3946
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:27,260
about when and how kids seem to have to
 

3947
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:28,839
about when and how kids seem to have to
at least come to certain understand

3948
01:05:28,839 --> 01:05:28,849
at least come to certain understand
 

3949
01:05:28,849 --> 01:05:31,809
at least come to certain understand
of basic aspects of physics so if you

3950
01:05:31,809 --> 01:05:31,819
of basic aspects of physics so if you
 

3951
01:05:31,819 --> 01:05:33,400
of basic aspects of physics so if you
really want to study how people learn to

3952
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:33,410
really want to study how people learn to
 

3953
01:05:33,410 --> 01:05:35,259
really want to study how people learn to
be intelligent a lot of what you have to

3954
01:05:35,259 --> 01:05:35,269
be intelligent a lot of what you have to
 

3955
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:36,999
be intelligent a lot of what you have to
study are kids at this age you have to

3956
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:37,009
study are kids at this age you have to
 

3957
01:05:37,009 --> 01:05:38,589
study are kids at this age you have to
study what's already in their brain at

3958
01:05:38,589 --> 01:05:38,599
study what's already in their brain at
 

3959
01:05:38,599 --> 01:05:40,870
study what's already in their brain at
zero months and what they learn and how

3960
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:40,880
zero months and what they learn and how
 

3961
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,609
zero months and what they learn and how
they learn between four six eight ten

3962
01:05:42,609 --> 01:05:42,619
they learn between four six eight ten
 

3963
01:05:42,619 --> 01:05:44,950
they learn between four six eight ten
twelve and so on and on up beyond that

3964
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:44,960
twelve and so on and on up beyond that
 

3965
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:48,219
twelve and so on and on up beyond that
okay now well effectively what that

3966
01:05:48,219 --> 01:05:48,229
okay now well effectively what that
 

3967
01:05:48,229 --> 01:05:50,529
okay now well effectively what that
amounts to we think is if what you're

3968
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:50,539
amounts to we think is if what you're
 

3969
01:05:50,539 --> 01:05:52,630
amounts to we think is if what you're
learning is something like a let's say

3970
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:52,640
learning is something like a let's say
 

3971
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,910
learning is something like a let's say
an intuitive game physics engine to

3972
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:54,920
an intuitive game physics engine to
 

3973
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,069
an intuitive game physics engine to
capture these basic abilities then what

3974
01:05:57,069 --> 01:05:57,079
capture these basic abilities then what
 

3975
01:05:57,079 --> 01:05:58,089
capture these basic abilities then what
we need if we're gonna try to

3976
01:05:58,089 --> 01:05:58,099
we need if we're gonna try to
 

3977
01:05:58,099 --> 01:06:00,219
we need if we're gonna try to
reverse-engineer that is what we might

3978
01:06:00,219 --> 01:06:00,229
reverse-engineer that is what we might
 

3979
01:06:00,229 --> 01:06:01,809
reverse-engineer that is what we might
think of as a program learning program

3980
01:06:01,809 --> 01:06:01,819
think of as a program learning program
 

3981
01:06:01,819 --> 01:06:03,160
think of as a program learning program
if your knowledge is in the form of a

3982
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:03,170
if your knowledge is in the form of a
 

3983
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:04,989
if your knowledge is in the form of a
program then you have to have programs

3984
01:06:04,989 --> 01:06:04,999
program then you have to have programs
 

3985
01:06:04,999 --> 01:06:06,789
program then you have to have programs
that build other programs right this is

3986
01:06:06,789 --> 01:06:06,799
that build other programs right this is
 

3987
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:07,779
that build other programs right this is
what I was talking about the beginning

3988
01:06:07,779 --> 01:06:07,789
what I was talking about the beginning
 

3989
01:06:07,789 --> 01:06:09,969
what I was talking about the beginning
about learning as building models of the

3990
01:06:09,969 --> 01:06:09,979
about learning as building models of the
 

3991
01:06:09,979 --> 01:06:12,370
about learning as building models of the
world or ultimately if you think what we

3992
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:12,380
world or ultimately if you think what we
 

3993
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:14,019
world or ultimately if you think what we
start off with is something like a game

3994
01:06:14,019 --> 01:06:14,029
start off with is something like a game
 

3995
01:06:14,029 --> 01:06:16,210
start off with is something like a game
engine that can play any game then what

3996
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:16,220
engine that can play any game then what
 

3997
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:17,739
engine that can play any game then what
you have to learn is the program of the

3998
01:06:17,739 --> 01:06:17,749
you have to learn is the program of the
 

3999
01:06:17,749 --> 01:06:19,239
you have to learn is the program of the
game that you're actually playing or the

4000
01:06:19,239 --> 01:06:19,249
game that you're actually playing or the
 

4001
01:06:19,249 --> 01:06:20,499
game that you're actually playing or the
many different games that you might be

4002
01:06:20,499 --> 01:06:20,509
many different games that you might be
 

4003
01:06:20,509 --> 01:06:22,150
many different games that you might be
playing over your life so think of

4004
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:22,160
playing over your life so think of
 

4005
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,039
playing over your life so think of
learning as like programming the game

4006
01:06:24,039 --> 01:06:24,049
learning as like programming the game
 

4007
01:06:24,049 --> 01:06:25,660
learning as like programming the game
engine in your head to fit with your

4008
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:25,670
engine in your head to fit with your
 

4009
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:27,370
engine in your head to fit with your
experience and and to fit with the

4010
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:27,380
experience and and to fit with the
 

4011
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:29,319
experience and and to fit with the
possibilities that you seem like you can

4012
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:29,329
possibilities that you seem like you can
 

4013
01:06:29,329 --> 01:06:31,479
possibilities that you seem like you can
take now this is what you could call the

4014
01:06:31,479 --> 01:06:31,489
take now this is what you could call the
 

4015
01:06:31,489 --> 01:06:33,130
take now this is what you could call the
hard problem of learning if you come to

4016
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:33,140
hard problem of learning if you come to
 

4017
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:34,630
hard problem of learning if you come to
learning from say neural networks or

4018
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:34,640
learning from say neural networks or
 

4019
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,339
learning from say neural networks or
other tools and machine learning right

4020
01:06:36,339 --> 01:06:36,349
other tools and machine learning right
 

4021
01:06:36,349 --> 01:06:38,170
other tools and machine learning right
so what makes machine makes most of

4022
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:38,180
so what makes machine makes most of
 

4023
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:39,670
so what makes machine makes most of
machine learning go right now and

4024
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:39,680
machine learning go right now and
 

4025
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:40,930
machine learning go right now and
certainly what makes neural network so

4026
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:40,940
certainly what makes neural network so
 

4027
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:42,940
certainly what makes neural network so
appealing is that you can set up a

4028
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:42,950
appealing is that you can set up a
 

4029
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:45,039
appealing is that you can set up a
basically a big function approximator

4030
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:45,049
basically a big function approximator
 

4031
01:06:45,049 --> 01:06:46,719
basically a big function approximator
that can approximate many of the

4032
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:46,729
that can approximate many of the
 

4033
01:06:46,729 --> 01:06:48,069
that can approximate many of the
functions you might want to do in a

4034
01:06:48,069 --> 01:06:48,079
functions you might want to do in a
 

4035
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:50,229
functions you might want to do in a
certain application or task but in a way

4036
01:06:50,229 --> 01:06:50,239
certain application or task but in a way
 

4037
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,759
certain application or task but in a way
that's end-to-end differentiable and

4038
01:06:51,759 --> 01:06:51,769
that's end-to-end differentiable and
 

4039
01:06:51,769 --> 01:06:54,160
that's end-to-end differentiable and
with a meaningful cost function so you

4040
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:54,170
with a meaningful cost function so you
 

4041
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:55,390
with a meaningful cost function so you
can have one of these nice optimization

4042
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:55,400
can have one of these nice optimization
 

4043
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,519
can have one of these nice optimization
landscapes you can compute the gradients

4044
01:06:57,519 --> 01:06:57,529
landscapes you can compute the gradients
 

4045
01:06:57,529 --> 01:06:58,930
landscapes you can compute the gradients
and basically just roll downhill until

4046
01:06:58,930 --> 01:06:58,940
and basically just roll downhill until
 

4047
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:02,140
and basically just roll downhill until
you get to an optimal solution but if

you get to an optimal solution but if
 

4049
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:03,249
you get to an optimal solution but if

01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:23,110
here's the right answer and probably you
 

4323
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:25,620
here's the right answer and probably you
couldn't tell the way we did this was by

so we basically said when you draw a

4330
01:11:30,209 --> 01:11:30,219
so we basically said when you draw a
 

4331
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:31,979
so we basically said when you draw a
character you're assembling strokes and

4332
01:11:31,979 --> 01:11:31,989
character you're assembling strokes and
 

4333

that produce ink on the page and when

4336
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:36,310
that produce ink on the page and when
 

4337
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:37,709
that produce ink on the page and when
you see a character you're working

4338
01:11:37,709 --> 01:11:37,719
you see a character you're working
 

4339
01:11:37,719 --> 01:11:39,149
you see a character you're working
backwards to figure out what was the

4340
01:11:39,149 --> 01:11:39,159
backwards to figure out what was the
 

4341
01:11:39,159 --> 01:11:40,979
backwards to figure out what was the
program the most efficient program that

4342
01:11:40,979 --> 01:11:40,989
program the most efficient program that
 

4343
01:11:40,989 --> 01:11:43,080
program the most efficient program that
did that so you're basically inverting a

4344
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:43,090
did that so you're basically inverting a
 

4345
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:44,910

01:14:24,650 --> 01:14:26,680
tried to show you how we're starting to
be able to understand those things what

4514
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:26,690
be able to understand those things what
 

4515
01:14:26,690 --> 01:14:28,990
be able to understand those things what
a baby's mind starts with how children

4516
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:29,000
a baby's mind starts with how children
 

4517
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,479
a baby's mind starts with how children
actually learn and looking forward we

4518
01:14:31,479 --> 01:14:31,489
actually learn and looking forward we
 

4519
01:14:31,489 --> 01:14:32,860
actually learn and looking forward we
might we might imagine that someday

4520
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:32,870
might we might imagine that someday
 

4521
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:34,479
might we might imagine that someday
we'll be able to build machines that can

4522
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:34,489
we'll be able to build machines that can
 

4523
01:14:34,489 --> 01:14:35,740
we'll be able to build machines that can
do this I think we can actually start

4524
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:35,750
do this I think we can actually start
 

4525
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:38,530
do this I think we can actually start
working on this right now and we're and

4526
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:38,540
working on this right now and we're and
 

4527
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:39,580
working on this right now and we're and
that's something that we're doing in our

4528
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:39,590
that's something that we're doing in our
 

4529
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:41,740
that's something that we're doing in our
group so if that kind of thing excites

4530
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:41,750
group so if that kind of thing excites
 

4531
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:43,240
group so if that kind of thing excites
you then I encourage you to work on it

4532
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:43,250
you then I encourage you to work on it
 

4533
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:44,979
you then I encourage you to work on it
maybe even with us or if any one of

4534
01:14:44,979 --> 01:14:44,989
maybe even with us or if any one of
 

4535
01:14:44,989 --> 01:14:46,240
maybe even with us or if any one of
these other activities of human

4536
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:46,250
these other activities of human
 

4537
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:49,270
these other activities of human
intelligence excite you I think taking

4538
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:49,280
intelligence excite you I think taking
 

4539
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,709
intelligence excite you I think taking
the kind of science-based reverse

4540
01:14:50,709 --> 01:14:50,719
the kind of science-based reverse
 

4541
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,149
the kind of science-based reverse
engineering approach that we're doing

4542
01:14:52,149 --> 01:14:52,159
engineering approach that we're doing
 

4543
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:53,950
engineering approach that we're doing
and then trying to put that into

4544
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:53,960
and then trying to put that into
 

4545
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:56,380
and then trying to put that into
engineering practice it's it's this is

4546
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:56,390
engineering practice it's it's this is
 

4547
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:58,360
engineering practice it's it's this is
this is a this is not just a possible

4548
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:58,370
this is a this is not just a possible
 

4549
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:00,340
this is a this is not just a possible
route but I think it's it's quite

4550
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:00,350
route but I think it's it's quite
 

4551
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:02,050
route but I think it's it's quite
possibly the most valuable route that

4552
01:15:02,050 --> 01:15:02,060
possibly the most valuable route that
 

4553
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:04,300
possibly the most valuable route that
you could work on right now to try to

4554
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:04,310
you could work on right now to try to
 

4555
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:06,160
you could work on right now to try to
actually achieve at least some kind of

4556
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:06,170
actually achieve at least some kind of
 

4557
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:07,530
actually achieve at least some kind of
artificial general intelligence

4558
01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:07,540
artificial general intelligence
 

4559
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:10,180
artificial general intelligence
especially the kind of intelligence AI

4560
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:10,190
especially the kind of intelligence AI
 

4561
01:15:10,190 --> 01:15:12,550
especially the kind of intelligence AI
system that's going to live in a human

4562
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:12,560
system that's going to live in a human
 

4563
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,050
system that's going to live in a human
world and interact with human there's

4564
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:14,060
world and interact with human there's
 

4565
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:15,729
world and interact with human there's
many kinds of AI systems that could live

4566
01:15:15,729 --> 01:15:15,739
many kinds of AI systems that could live
 

4567
01:15:15,739 --> 01:15:17,200
many kinds of AI systems that could live
in worlds of data that none of us can

4568
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:17,210
in worlds of data that none of us can
 

4569
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:18,399
in worlds of data that none of us can
understand or will ever live in

4570
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:18,409
understand or will ever live in
 

4571
01:15:18,409 --> 01:15:19,870
understand or will ever live in
ourselves but if you want to build

4572
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:19,880
ourselves but if you want to build
 

4573
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,459
ourselves but if you want to build
machines that can live in our world and

4574
01:15:21,459 --> 01:15:21,469
machines that can live in our world and
 

4575
01:15:21,469 --> 01:15:23,649
machines that can live in our world and
interact with us the way we are used to

4576
01:15:23,649 --> 01:15:23,659
interact with us the way we are used to
 

4577
01:15:23,659 --> 01:15:25,540
interact with us the way we are used to
interacting with other people then I

4578
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:25,550
interacting with other people then I
 

4579
01:15:25,550 --> 01:15:27,189
interacting with other people then I
think this is a route that you should

4580
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:27,199
think this is a route that you should
 

4581
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:28,860
think this is a route that you should
consider okay thank you

4582
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:28,870
consider okay thank you
 

4583
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:38,250
consider okay thank you

4585
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:41,199

hi there so early in the talk you

4586
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:41,209
hi there so early in the talk you
 

4587
01:15:41,209 --> 01:15:42,819
hi there so early in the talk you
expressed some skepticism about whether

4588
01:15:42,819 --> 01:15:42,829
expressed some skepticism about whether
 

4589
01:15:42,829 --> 01:15:44,770
expressed some skepticism about whether
or not industry would get us to

4590
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:44,780
or not industry would get us to
 

4591
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:46,140
or not industry would get us to
understanding human level intelligence

4592
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:46,150
understanding human level intelligence
 

4593
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:48,219
understanding human level intelligence
it seems that there's a couple of trends

4594
01:15:48,219 --> 01:15:48,229
it seems that there's a couple of trends
 

4595
01:15:48,229 --> 01:15:50,350
it seems that there's a couple of trends
that favor industry one is the industry

4596
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:50,360
that favor industry one is the industry
 

4597
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:51,310
that favor industry one is the industry
is better than that academia

4598
01:15:51,310 --> 01:15:51,320
is better than that academia
 

4599
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:53,770
is better than that academia
accumulating resources and plowing back

4600
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:53,780
accumulating resources and plowing back
 

4601
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:56,109
accumulating resources and plowing back
into the topic and it seems at the

4602
01:15:56,109 --> 01:15:56,119
into the topic and it seems at the
 

4603
01:15:56,119 --> 01:15:57,520
into the topic and it seems at the
moment we've got a bit of brain drain

4604
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:57,530
moment we've got a bit of brain drain
 

4605
01:15:57,530 --> 01:16:00,040
moment we've got a bit of brain drain
going on form academia into industry and

4606
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:00,050
going on form academia into industry and
 

4607
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:02,589
going on form academia into industry and
that seems like a on going trend yeah if

4608
01:16:02,589 --> 01:16:02,599
that seems like a on going trend yeah if
 

4609
01:16:02,599 --> 01:16:03,910
that seems like a on going trend yeah if
you look at something like learning to

4610
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:03,920
you look at something like learning to
 

4611
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,669
you look at something like learning to
fly or learning to fly into space then

4612
01:16:06,669 --> 01:16:06,679
fly or learning to fly into space then
 

4613
01:16:06,679 --> 01:16:09,370
fly or learning to fly into space then
it looks like a story is one of Industry

4614
01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:09,380
it looks like a story is one of Industry
 

4615
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:12,129
it looks like a story is one of Industry
kind of taking over the field and going

4616
01:16:12,129 --> 01:16:12,139
kind of taking over the field and going
 

4617
01:16:12,139 --> 01:16:13,209
kind of taking over the field and going
off on its own yeah a little bit

4618
01:16:13,209 --> 01:16:13,219
off on its own yeah a little bit
 

4619
01:16:13,219 --> 01:16:16,209
off on its own yeah a little bit
academia academics still have a role but

4620
01:16:16,209 --> 01:16:16,219
academia academics still have a role but
 

4621
01:16:16,219 --> 01:16:17,890
academia academics still have a role but
industry kind of dominates so yes is

4622
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:17,900
industry kind of dominates so yes is
 

4623
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,750
industry kind of dominates so yes is
industry going to overtake the field you

4624
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:19,760
industry going to overtake the field you
 

4625
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,310
industry going to overtake the field you
think well that's a really good question

4626
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:21,320
think well that's a really good question
 

4627
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,810
think well that's a really good question
and it's got several good questions

4628
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:22,820
and it's got several good questions
 

4629
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:24,549
and it's got several good questions
packed into one there right I didn't

4630
01:16:24,549 --> 01:16:24,559
packed into one there right I didn't
 

4631
01:16:24,559 --> 01:16:26,379
packed into one there right I didn't
mean to say I didn't this wasn't meant

4632
01:16:26,379 --> 01:16:26,389
mean to say I didn't this wasn't meant
 

4633
01:16:26,389 --> 01:16:29,140
mean to say I didn't this wasn't meant
to say go academia bad industry right

4634
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:29,150
to say go academia bad industry right
 

4635
01:16:29,150 --> 01:16:31,239
to say go academia bad industry right
what I was taught what I what I tried to

4636
01:16:31,239 --> 01:16:31,249
what I was taught what I what I tried to
 

4637
01:16:31,249 --> 01:16:33,790
what I was taught what I what I tried to
say was the approaches that are

4638
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:33,800
say was the approaches that are
 

4639
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,410
say was the approaches that are
currently getting the most attention in

4640
01:16:35,410 --> 01:16:35,420
currently getting the most attention in
 

4641
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:37,270
currently getting the most attention in
industry and they're really because

4642
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:37,280
industry and they're really because
 

4643
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:38,529
industry and they're really because
they're really the most valuable ones

4644
01:16:38,529 --> 01:16:38,539
they're really the most valuable ones
 

4645
01:16:38,539 --> 01:16:39,969
they're really the most valuable ones
right now for the short term you know

4646
01:16:39,969 --> 01:16:39,979
right now for the short term you know
 

4647
01:16:39,979 --> 01:16:41,680
right now for the short term you know
any industry is really focused on what

4648
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:41,690
any industry is really focused on what
 

4649
01:16:41,690 --> 01:16:43,540
any industry is really focused on what
it can do what are the value

4650
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:43,550
it can do what are the value
 

4651
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:45,160
it can do what are the value
propositions on basically a two year

4652
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:45,170
propositions on basically a two year
 

4653
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:46,750
propositions on basically a two year
time scale at most I mean if you ask say

4654
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:46,760
time scale at most I mean if you ask say
 

4655
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:47,979
time scale at most I mean if you ask say
Google researchers to take the most

4656
01:16:47,979 --> 01:16:47,989
Google researchers to take the most
 

4657
01:16:47,989 --> 01:16:50,169
Google researchers to take the most
prominent example it's pretty much what

4658
01:16:50,169 --> 01:16:50,179
prominent example it's pretty much what
 

4659
01:16:50,179 --> 01:16:52,989
prominent example it's pretty much what
they'll all tell you okay maybe maybe

4660
01:16:52,989 --> 01:16:52,999
they'll all tell you okay maybe maybe
 

4661
01:16:52,999 --> 01:16:55,359
they'll all tell you okay maybe maybe
things that might you know pay off

4662
01:16:55,359 --> 01:16:55,369
things that might you know pay off
 

4663
01:16:55,369 --> 01:16:56,979
things that might you know pay off
initially in two years but maybe take

4664
01:16:56,979 --> 01:16:56,989
initially in two years but maybe take
 

4665
01:16:56,989 --> 01:16:58,600
initially in two years but maybe take
five years or more to really develop but

4666
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:58,610
five years or more to really develop but
 

4667
01:16:58,610 --> 01:17:00,370
five years or more to really develop but
if if you can't show that it's gonna do

4668
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:00,380
if if you can't show that it's gonna do
 

4669
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:02,049
if if you can't show that it's gonna do
something practical for us in two years

4670
01:17:02,049 --> 01:17:02,059
something practical for us in two years
 

4671
01:17:02,059 --> 01:17:03,489
something practical for us in two years
in a way that matters for our bottom

4672
01:17:03,489 --> 01:17:03,499
in a way that matters for our bottom
 

4673
01:17:03,499 --> 01:17:04,989
in a way that matters for our bottom
line then it's not really worth doing

4674
01:17:04,989 --> 01:17:04,999
line then it's not really worth doing
 

4675
01:17:04,999 --> 01:17:08,229
line then it's not really worth doing
okay so what when we say what I'm

4676
01:17:08,229 --> 01:17:08,239
okay so what when we say what I'm
 

4677
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:09,819
okay so what when we say what I'm
talking about is the technologies which

4678
01:17:09,819 --> 01:17:09,829
talking about is the technologies which
 

4679
01:17:09,829 --> 01:17:12,100
talking about is the technologies which
right now industry sees as meeting that

4680
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:12,110
right now industry sees as meeting that
 

4681
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:14,259
right now industry sees as meeting that
specification and what I'm saying is

4682
01:17:14,259 --> 01:17:14,269
specification and what I'm saying is
 

4683
01:17:14,269 --> 01:17:16,629
specification and what I'm saying is
right now I think those that's that's

4684
01:17:16,629 --> 01:17:16,639
right now I think those that's that's
 

4685
01:17:16,639 --> 01:17:19,299
right now I think those that's that's
not where the route is to something like

4686
01:17:19,299 --> 01:17:19,309
not where the route is to something like
 

4687
01:17:19,309 --> 01:17:21,339
not where the route is to something like
human-like but not the most valuable

4688
01:17:21,339 --> 01:17:21,349
human-like but not the most valuable
 

4689
01:17:21,349 --> 01:17:23,709
human-like but not the most valuable
promising route to human-like kinds of

4690
01:17:23,709 --> 01:17:23,719
promising route to human-like kinds of
 

4691
01:17:23,719 --> 01:17:25,959
promising route to human-like kinds of
AI systems all right but I hope that

4692
01:17:25,959 --> 01:17:25,969
AI systems all right but I hope that
 

4693
01:17:25,969 --> 01:17:28,029
AI systems all right but I hope that
like in the cases you said you know the

4694
01:17:28,029 --> 01:17:28,039
like in the cases you said you know the
 

4695
01:17:28,039 --> 01:17:29,709
like in the cases you said you know the
basic research that we're doing now will

4696
01:17:29,709 --> 01:17:29,719
basic research that we're doing now will
 

4697
01:17:29,719 --> 01:17:31,959
basic research that we're doing now will
be successful enough that it will get

4698
01:17:31,959 --> 01:17:31,969
be successful enough that it will get
 

4699
01:17:31,969 --> 01:17:33,609
be successful enough that it will get
the attention of industry when the time

4700
01:17:33,609 --> 01:17:33,619
the attention of industry when the time
 

4701
01:17:33,619 --> 01:17:35,979
the attention of industry when the time
is right but I think so you know I mean

4702
01:17:35,979 --> 01:17:35,989
is right but I think so you know I mean
 

4703
01:17:35,989 --> 01:17:38,649
is right but I think so you know I mean
I hope at some point you know it won't

4704
01:17:38,649 --> 01:17:38,659
I hope at some point you know it won't
 

4705
01:17:38,659 --> 01:17:40,270
I hope at some point you know it won't
it will only at least the engineering

4706
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:40,280
it will only at least the engineering
 

4707
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,699
it will only at least the engineering
side will have to be done in industry

4708
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:41,709
side will have to be done in industry
 

4709
01:17:41,709 --> 01:17:44,859
side will have to be done in industry
not just in academia but you're also

4710
01:17:44,859 --> 01:17:44,869
not just in academia but you're also
 

4711
01:17:44,869 --> 01:17:46,569
not just in academia but you're also
pointing to issues of like brain drain

4712
01:17:46,569 --> 01:17:46,579
pointing to issues of like brain drain
 

4713
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:47,529
pointing to issues of like brain drain
and other things like that

4714
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:47,539
and other things like that
 

4715
01:17:47,539 --> 01:17:48,910
and other things like that
but I think it's these are real issues

4716
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:48,920
but I think it's these are real issues
 

4717
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,199
but I think it's these are real issues
confronting our community I think

4718
01:17:50,199 --> 01:17:50,209
confronting our community I think
 

4719
01:17:50,209 --> 01:17:51,400
confronting our community I think
everybody knows this and I'm

4720
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:51,410
everybody knows this and I'm
 

4721
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:53,320
everybody knows this and I'm
this will come up multiple times here

4722
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:53,330
this will come up multiple times here
 

4723
01:17:53,330 --> 01:17:55,960
this will come up multiple times here
which is you know I think we have to

4724
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:55,970
which is you know I think we have to
 

4725
01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:58,690
which is you know I think we have to
find ways to even now to combine the

4726
01:17:58,690 --> 01:17:58,700
find ways to even now to combine the
 

4727
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:00,760
find ways to even now to combine the
best of the idea of the energy and the

4728
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:00,770
best of the idea of the energy and the
 

4729
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:03,190
best of the idea of the energy and the
resources of academia and industry if we

4730
01:18:03,190 --> 01:18:03,200
resources of academia and industry if we
 

4731
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:05,440
resources of academia and industry if we
want to keep doing basically something

4732
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:05,450
want to keep doing basically something
 

4733
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:07,750
want to keep doing basically something
interesting right if we will if we just

4734
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:07,760
interesting right if we will if we just
 

4735
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,820
interesting right if we will if we just
want to redefine AI to be well whatever

4736
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:09,830
want to redefine AI to be well whatever
 

4737
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:11,770
want to redefine AI to be well whatever
people currently call AI but scaled up

4738
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:11,780
people currently call AI but scaled up
 

4739
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:14,260
people currently call AI but scaled up
well then then then fine forget about it

4740
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:14,270
well then then then fine forget about it
 

4741
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:16,450
well then then then fine forget about it
and or if we just want to say let me and

4742
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:16,460
and or if we just want to say let me and
 

4743
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:18,190
and or if we just want to say let me and
people like me do what we're doing at

4744
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:18,200
people like me do what we're doing at
 

4745
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:19,750
people like me do what we're doing at
what industry would consider a snail's

4746
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:19,760
what industry would consider a snail's
 

4747
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,210
what industry would consider a snail's
pace on toy problems okay fine but if

4748
01:18:22,210 --> 01:18:22,220
pace on toy problems okay fine but if
 

4749
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:24,940
pace on toy problems okay fine but if
but if we want to if you know if I want

4750
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:24,950
but if we want to if you know if I want
 

4751
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,740
but if we want to if you know if I want
to take what I'm doing to the level that

4752
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:26,750
to take what I'm doing to the level that
 

4753
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:28,960
to take what I'm doing to the level that
that will really be you know paying off

4754
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:28,970
that will really be you know paying off
 

4755
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:30,850
that will really be you know paying off
that level the industry can appreciate

4756
01:18:30,850 --> 01:18:30,860
that level the industry can appreciate
 

4757
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:32,500
that level the industry can appreciate
or just that really has technological

4758
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:32,510
or just that really has technological
 

4759
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:35,380
or just that really has technological
impact on a broad scale right or I think

4760
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:35,390
impact on a broad scale right or I think
 

4761
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:37,000
impact on a broad scale right or I think
if industry wants to take what it's

4762
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:37,010
if industry wants to take what it's
 

4763
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:38,980
if industry wants to take what it's
doing and really build machines that are

4764
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:38,990
doing and really build machines that are
 

4765
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:41,260
doing and really build machines that are
actually intelligent right our machine

4766
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:41,270
actually intelligent right our machine
 

4767
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:42,700
actually intelligent right our machine
learning that actually learns like a

4768
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:42,710
learning that actually learns like a
 

4769
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:44,170
learning that actually learns like a
person then I think we need each other

4770
01:18:44,170 --> 01:18:44,180
person then I think we need each other
 

4771
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:46,030
person then I think we need each other
now and not just in some point in the

4772
01:18:46,030 --> 01:18:46,040
now and not just in some point in the
 

4773
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:47,950
now and not just in some point in the
future so this is a general challenge

4774
01:18:47,950 --> 01:18:47,960
future so this is a general challenge
 

4775
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,930
future so this is a general challenge
for MIT and for everywhere and for

4776
01:18:49,930 --> 01:18:49,940
for MIT and for everywhere and for
 

4777
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:51,580
for MIT and for everywhere and for
Google I mean we just spent a few days

4778
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:51,590
Google I mean we just spent a few days
 

4779
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:53,860
Google I mean we just spent a few days
talking to Google about exactly this

4780
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:53,870
talking to Google about exactly this
 

4781
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:56,140
talking to Google about exactly this
issue that this was a talk I prepared

4782
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:56,150
issue that this was a talk I prepared
 

4783
01:18:56,150 --> 01:18:58,390
issue that this was a talk I prepared
partly for that purpose so we wanted to

4784
01:18:58,390 --> 01:18:58,400
partly for that purpose so we wanted to
 

4785
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,400
partly for that purpose so we wanted to
raise those issues and and it's just I

4786
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:00,410
raise those issues and and it's just I
 

4787
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:01,780
raise those issues and and it's just I
mean really there I don't know what I

4788
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:01,790
mean really there I don't know what I
 

4789
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:02,950
mean really there I don't know what I
mean well rather I can think of some

4790
01:19:02,950 --> 01:19:02,960
mean well rather I can think of some
 

4791
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:06,580
mean well rather I can think of some
solutions to that problem of what you

4792
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:06,590
solutions to that problem of what you
 

4793
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:08,140
solutions to that problem of what you
could call brain drain from the academic

4794
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:08,150
could call brain drain from the academic
 

4795
01:19:08,150 --> 01:19:09,280
could call brain drain from the academic
point of view or what you could call

4796
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:09,290
point of view or what you could call
 

4797
01:19:09,290 --> 01:19:11,410
point of view or what you could call
just narrowing in into certain local

4798
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:11,420
just narrowing in into certain local
 

4799
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:13,300
just narrowing in into certain local
minima in the industry point of view but

4800
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:13,310
minima in the industry point of view but
 

4801
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:15,670
minima in the industry point of view but
they will require the leadership of both

4802
01:19:15,670 --> 01:19:15,680
they will require the leadership of both
 

4803
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,920
they will require the leadership of both
academic institutions like MIT and

4804
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:17,930
academic institutions like MIT and
 

4805
01:19:17,930 --> 01:19:19,450
academic institutions like MIT and
companies like Google being creative

4806
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:19,460
companies like Google being creative
 

4807
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:20,770
companies like Google being creative
about how they might work together in

4808
01:19:20,770 --> 01:19:20,780
about how they might work together in
 

4809
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:21,970
about how they might work together in
ways that are a little bit outside of

4810
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:21,980
ways that are a little bit outside of
 

4811
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:23,470
ways that are a little bit outside of
their comfort zone I hope that will

4812
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:23,480
their comfort zone I hope that will
 

4813
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:27,130
their comfort zone I hope that will
start to happen including at MIT and at

4814
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:27,140
start to happen including at MIT and at
 

4815
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:28,720
start to happen including at MIT and at
many other universities and at companies

4816
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:28,730
many other universities and at companies
 

4817
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:30,250
many other universities and at companies
like Google and many others and I think

4818
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:30,260
like Google and many others and I think
 

4819
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:31,900
like Google and many others and I think
we need it to happen for the health of

4820
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:31,910
we need it to happen for the health of
 

4821
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:34,240
we need it to happen for the health of
all parties concerned okay thank you

4822
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:34,250
all parties concerned okay thank you
 

4823
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:38,500
all parties concerned okay thank you
very much things I'm curious about sort

4824
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:38,510
very much things I'm curious about sort
 

4825
01:19:38,510 --> 01:19:41,380
very much things I'm curious about sort
of the premise that you gave that one of

4826
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:41,390
of the premise that you gave that one of
 

4827
01:19:41,390 --> 01:19:43,420
of the premise that you gave that one of
the big gaps missing at determining

4828
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:43,430
the big gaps missing at determining
 

4829
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:45,750
the big gaps missing at determining
intelligence is the fact that we need to

4830
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:45,760
intelligence is the fact that we need to
 

4831
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:49,030
intelligence is the fact that we need to
teach machines how to recognize models

4832
01:19:49,030 --> 01:19:49,040
teach machines how to recognize models
 

4833
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:51,900
teach machines how to recognize models
and I'm curious as to what you think

4834
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:51,910
and I'm curious as to what you think
 

4835
01:19:51,910 --> 01:19:56,440
and I'm curious as to what you think
sort of non goal oriented cognitive

4836
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:56,450
sort of non goal oriented cognitive
 

4837
01:19:56,450 --> 01:19:58,390
sort of non goal oriented cognitive
activity comes into play they're things

4838
01:19:58,390 --> 01:19:58,400
activity comes into play they're things
 

4839
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,689
activity comes into play they're things
like feelings and emotions

4840
01:20:00,689 --> 01:20:00,699
like feelings and emotions
 

4841
01:20:00,699 --> 01:20:04,709
like feelings and emotions
and and y-you don't think that might not

4842
01:20:04,709 --> 01:20:04,719
and and y-you don't think that might not
 

4843
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:08,100
and and y-you don't think that might not
necessarily be like that the no I'm I

4844
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:08,110
necessarily be like that the no I'm I
 

4845
01:20:08,110 --> 01:20:11,129
necessarily be like that the no I'm I

emotions didn't appear on my slide is

4848
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:12,760
emotions didn't appear on my slide is
 

4849
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:15,270
emotions didn't appear on my slide is
because there's a few reasons but the

4850
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:15,280
because there's a few reasons but the
 

4851
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:16,979
because there's a few reasons but the
slide is only so big I wanted the font

4852
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:16,989
slide is only so big I wanted the font
 

4853
01:20:16,989 --> 01:20:18,930
slide is only so big I wanted the font
to be big readable for such an important

4854
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:18,940
to be big readable for such an important

slide I've had versions of my slide in
 

4857
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:25,140
slide I've had versions of my slide in
which I do talk about that okay it's not

4858
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:25,150
which I do talk about that okay it's not
 

4859
01:20:25,150 --> 01:20:26,819
which I do talk about that okay it's not
that I think feelings or emotions aren't

4860
01:20:26,819 --> 01:20:26,829
that I think feelings or emotions aren't
 

4861
01:20:26,829 --> 01:20:28,529
that I think feelings or emotions aren't
important I think they are important and

4862
01:20:28,529 --> 01:20:28,539
important I think they are important and
 

4863
01:20:28,539 --> 01:20:30,569
important I think they are important and
I used to not have many insights on it

4864
01:20:30,569 --> 01:20:30,579
I used to not have many insights on it
 

4865
01:20:30,579 --> 01:20:32,850
I used to not have many insights on it
about what to do about them but actually

4866
01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:32,860
about what to do about them but actually
 

4867
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:34,229
about what to do about them but actually

colleagues in who I work closely with
 

4875
01:20:40,949 --> 01:20:44,549
colleagues in who I work closely with
they've been starting to do research on

4876
01:20:44,549 --> 01:20:44,559
they've been starting to do research on
 

4877
01:20:44,559 --> 01:20:46,109
they've been starting to do research on
how people understand emotions both

4878
01:20:46,109 --> 01:20:46,119
how people understand emotions both
 

4879
01:20:46,119 --> 01:20:47,580
how people understand emotions both
their own and others and we've been

4880
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:47,590
their own and others and we've been
 

4881
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:48,449
their own and others and we've been
starting to work with them on

4882
01:20:48,449 --> 01:20:48,459
starting to work with them on
 

4883
01:20:48,459 --> 01:20:49,890
starting to work with them on
computational models so that's actually

4884
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:49,900
computational models so that's actually
 

4885
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:51,569
computational models so that's actually
something I'm actively interested in and

4886
01:20:51,569 --> 01:20:51,579
something I'm actively interested in and
 

4887
01:20:51,579 --> 01:20:53,520
something I'm actively interested in and
even working on but I would say and

4888
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:53,530
even working on but I would say and
 

4889
01:20:53,530 --> 01:20:55,080
even working on but I would say and
again for those of you who study emotion

4890
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:55,090
again for those of you who study emotion
 

4891
01:20:55,090 --> 01:20:55,919
again for those of you who study emotion
to know about this actually you're gonna

4892
01:20:55,919 --> 01:20:55,929
to know about this actually you're gonna
 

4893
01:20:55,929 --> 01:20:58,229
to know about this actually you're gonna
have Lisa coming in right oh so she's

4894
01:20:58,229 --> 01:20:58,239
have Lisa coming in right oh so she's
 

4895
01:20:58,239 --> 01:20:59,609
have Lisa coming in right oh so she's
gonna basically say a version of the

4896
01:20:59,609 --> 01:20:59,619
gonna basically say a version of the
 

4897
01:20:59,619 --> 01:21:01,859
gonna basically say a version of the
same thing I think the deepest way to

4898
01:21:01,859 --> 01:21:01,869
same thing I think the deepest way to
 

4899
01:21:01,869 --> 01:21:03,180
same thing I think the deepest way to
understand she's one of the world's

4900
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:03,190
understand she's one of the world's
 

4901
01:21:03,190 --> 01:21:04,859
understand she's one of the world's
experts on this the deepest way to

4902
01:21:04,859 --> 01:21:04,869
experts on this the deepest way to
 

4903
01:21:04,869 --> 01:21:06,989
experts on this the deepest way to
understand emotion is very much based on

4904
01:21:06,989 --> 01:21:06,999
understand emotion is very much based on
 

4905
01:21:06,999 --> 01:21:08,910
understand emotion is very much based on
our mental models of ourselves of the

4906
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:08,920
our mental models of ourselves of the
 

4907
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:10,319
our mental models of ourselves of the
situation we're in and of other people

4908
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:10,329
situation we're in and of other people
 

4909
01:21:10,329 --> 01:21:13,830
situation we're in and of other people
right think about for example all of the

4910
01:21:13,830 --> 01:21:13,840
right think about for example all of the
 

4911
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,560
right think about for example all of the
different I mean if you you know if you

4912
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:16,570
different I mean if you you know if you
 

4913
01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:17,790
different I mean if you you know if you
think about it I mean again Lisa will

4914
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:17,800
think about it I mean again Lisa will
 

4915
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:18,839
think about it I mean again Lisa will
talk all about this but if you think

4916
01:21:18,839 --> 01:21:18,849
talk all about this but if you think
 

4917
01:21:18,849 --> 01:21:20,699
talk all about this but if you think
about emotion as just a very small set

4918
01:21:20,699 --> 01:21:20,709
about emotion as just a very small set
 

4919
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:21,899
about emotion as just a very small set
of what are sometimes called basic

4920
01:21:21,899 --> 01:21:21,909
of what are sometimes called basic
 

4921
01:21:21,909 --> 01:21:24,750
of what are sometimes called basic
emotions like being happy or angry or

4922
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:24,760
emotions like being happy or angry or
 

4923
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:29,189
emotions like being happy or angry or
sad or you know those are a small number

4924
01:21:29,189 --> 01:21:29,199
sad or you know those are a small number
 

4925
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:31,169
sad or you know those are a small number
of them right there's usually only few

4926
01:21:31,169 --> 01:21:31,179
of them right there's usually only few
 

4927
01:21:31,179 --> 01:21:34,410
of them right there's usually only few
right you might not say you might see

4928
01:21:34,410 --> 01:21:34,420
right you might not say you might see
 

4929
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:36,330
right you might not say you might see
that it's somehow like very basic things

4930
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:36,340
that it's somehow like very basic things
 

4931
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:37,979
that it's somehow like very basic things
that are opposed to some kind of

4932
01:21:37,979 --> 01:21:37,989
that are opposed to some kind of
 

4933
01:21:37,989 --> 01:21:40,049
that are opposed to some kind of
cognitive activity but think about all

4934
01:21:40,049 --> 01:21:40,059
cognitive activity but think about all
 

4935
01:21:40,059 --> 01:21:41,790
cognitive activity but think about all
the different words we have for emotion

4936
01:21:41,790 --> 01:21:41,800
the different words we have for emotion
 

4937
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:44,850
the different words we have for emotion
right for example think about an a

4938
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:44,860
right for example think about an a
 

4939
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:47,129
right for example think about an a
famous cognitive emotion like regret

4940
01:21:47,129 --> 01:21:47,139
famous cognitive emotion like regret
 

4941
01:21:47,139 --> 01:21:49,319
famous cognitive emotion like regret
what does it mean to feel regret or

4942
01:21:49,319 --> 01:21:49,329
what does it mean to feel regret or
 

4943
01:21:49,329 --> 01:21:52,770
what does it mean to feel regret or
frustration right just to know both for

4944
01:21:52,770 --> 01:21:52,780
frustration right just to know both for
 

4945
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:54,810
frustration right just to know both for
yourself when you're not just feeling

4946
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:54,820
yourself when you're not just feeling
 

4947
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:56,580
yourself when you're not just feeling
kind of down or negative but you're

4948
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:56,590
kind of down or negative but you're
 

4949
01:21:56,590 --> 01:21:58,439
kind of down or negative but you're
feeling regret that that means something

4950
01:21:58,439 --> 01:21:58,449
feeling regret that that means something
 

4951
01:21:58,449 --> 01:22:00,569
feeling regret that that means something
like I have to feel like there's a

4952
01:22:00,569 --> 01:22:00,579
like I have to feel like there's a
 

4953
01:22:00,579 --> 01:22:02,520
like I have to feel like there's a
situation that came out differently from

4954
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:02,530
situation that came out differently from
 

4955
01:22:02,530 --> 01:22:05,160
situation that came out differently from
how I hoped and I realize I could have

4956
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:05,170
how I hoped and I realize I could have
 

4957
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:07,379
how I hoped and I realize I could have
done something differently right so that

4958
01:22:07,379 --> 01:22:07,389
done something differently right so that
 

4959
01:22:07,389 --> 01:22:08,850
done something differently right so that
means you have to be able to understand

4960
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:08,860
means you have to be able to understand
 

4961
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:10,770
means you have to be able to understand
you have to have a model you have to be

4962
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:10,780
you have to have a model you have to be
 

4963
01:22:10,780 --> 01:22:12,270
you have to have a model you have to be
able to do a kind of counterfactual

4964
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:12,280
able to do a kind of counterfactual
 

4965
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:13,799
able to do a kind of counterfactual
reasoning and to think oh if only I had

4966
01:22:13,799 --> 01:22:13,809
reasoning and to think oh if only I had
 

4967
01:22:13,809 --> 01:22:14,430
reasoning and to think oh if only I had
acted to differ

4968
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:14,440
acted to differ
 

4969
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:15,990
acted to differ
way then I can predict that the world

4970
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:16,000
way then I can predict that the world
 

4971
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:16,860
way then I can predict that the world
would have come out differently and

4972
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:16,870
would have come out differently and
 

4973
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:18,270
would have come out differently and
that's the situation I wanted but

4974
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:18,280
that's the situation I wanted but
 

4975
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,010
that's the situation I wanted but
instead it came up this other way right

4976
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:20,020
instead it came up this other way right
 

4977
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:23,040
instead it came up this other way right
or think about frustration again that

4978
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:23,050
or think about frustration again that
 

4979
01:22:23,050 --> 01:22:24,600
or think about frustration again that
requires something like understanding

4980
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:24,610
requires something like understanding
 

4981
01:22:24,610 --> 01:22:26,250
requires something like understanding
okay I've tried a bunch of times I

4982
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:26,260
okay I've tried a bunch of times I
 

4983
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:27,840
okay I've tried a bunch of times I
thought this would work but it doesn't

4984
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:27,850
thought this would work but it doesn't
 

4985
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:29,430
thought this would work but it doesn't
seem to be working maybe I'm ready to

4986
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:29,440
seem to be working maybe I'm ready to
 

4987
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,740
seem to be working maybe I'm ready to
give up though those are all those are

4988
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:31,750
give up though those are all those are
 

4989
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:33,630
give up though those are all those are
those are very important human emotions

4990
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:33,640
those are very important human emotions
 

4991
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:35,670
those are very important human emotions
we have to understand to understand

4992
01:22:35,670 --> 01:22:35,680
we have to understand to understand
 

4993
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:36,990
we have to understand to understand
ourselves we need that to understand

4994
01:22:36,990 --> 01:22:37,000
ourselves we need that to understand
 

4995
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,209
ourselves we need that to understand
other people to understand communication

4996
01:22:38,209 --> 01:22:38,219
other people to understand communication
 

4997
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:40,350
other people to understand communication
but those are all filtered through the

4998
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:40,360
but those are all filtered through the
 

4999
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:42,689
but those are all filtered through the
kinds of models of action that I was

5000
01:22:42,689 --> 01:22:42,699
kinds of models of action that I was
 

5001
01:22:42,699 --> 01:22:44,430
kinds of models of action that I was
just the ones I was talking about here

5002
01:22:44,430 --> 01:22:44,440
just the ones I was talking about here
 

5003
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:46,140
just the ones I was talking about here
with these say cost-benefit analyses of

5004
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:46,150
with these say cost-benefit analyses of
 

5005
01:22:46,150 --> 01:22:48,030
with these say cost-benefit analyses of
action so what I'm so I'm just trying to

5006
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:48,040
action so what I'm so I'm just trying to
 

5007
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,560
action so what I'm so I'm just trying to
say I think this is very basic stuff

5008
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:49,570
say I think this is very basic stuff
 

5009
01:22:49,570 --> 01:22:52,620
say I think this is very basic stuff
that will be the basis for building I

5010
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:52,630
that will be the basis for building I
 

5011
01:22:52,630 --> 01:22:55,200
that will be the basis for building I
think better engineering style models of

5012
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:55,210
think better engineering style models of
 

5013
01:22:55,210 --> 01:22:56,700
think better engineering style models of
the full spectrum of human emotion

5014
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:56,710
the full spectrum of human emotion
 

5015
01:22:56,710 --> 01:22:58,320
the full spectrum of human emotion
beyond just like well I'm feeling good

5016
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:58,330
beyond just like well I'm feeling good
 

5017
01:22:58,330 --> 01:22:59,820
beyond just like well I'm feeling good
or bad or scared okay

5018
01:22:59,820 --> 01:22:59,830
or bad or scared okay
 

5019
01:22:59,830 --> 01:23:01,979
or bad or scared okay
and if I think when you see Lisa she

5020
01:23:01,979 --> 01:23:01,989
and if I think when you see Lisa she
 

5021
01:23:01,989 --> 01:23:03,870
and if I think when you see Lisa she
will in her own way say something very

5022
01:23:03,870 --> 01:23:03,880
will in her own way say something very
 

5023
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:08,250
will in her own way say something very
similar interesting thanks yeah thanks

5024
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:08,260
similar interesting thanks yeah thanks
 

5025
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:10,290
similar interesting thanks yeah thanks
Josh for your nice talk so all is about

5026
01:23:10,290 --> 01:23:10,300
Josh for your nice talk so all is about
 

5027
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:12,150
Josh for your nice talk so all is about
human cognition and try to build a model

5028
01:23:12,150 --> 01:23:12,160
human cognition and try to build a model
 

5029
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:14,729
human cognition and try to build a model
to mimic those cognition but you don't

5030
01:23:14,729 --> 01:23:14,739
to mimic those cognition but you don't
 

5031
01:23:14,739 --> 01:23:16,530
to mimic those cognition but you don't
how much could help you to understand

5032
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:16,540
how much could help you to understand
 

5033
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:18,270
how much could help you to understand
how the circuit implement those things

5034
01:23:18,270 --> 01:23:18,280
how the circuit implement those things
 

5035
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:19,830
how the circuit implement those things
hmm I mean like these circuits in the

5036
01:23:19,830 --> 01:23:19,840
hmm I mean like these circuits in the
 

5037
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:22,560
hmm I mean like these circuits in the
brain yeah yeah that's the is that what

5038
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:22,570
brain yeah yeah that's the is that what
 

5039
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:24,450
brain yeah yeah that's the is that what
you work on by any chance is that what

5040
01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:24,460
you work on by any chance is that what
 

5041
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:27,660
you work on by any chance is that what
you work on by any chance yeah yeah yeah

5042
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:27,670
you work on by any chance yeah yeah yeah
 

5043
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:30,240
you work on by any chance yeah yeah yeah
so so in the Center for brains minds of

5044
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:30,250
so so in the Center for brains minds of
 

5045
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:31,920
so so in the Center for brains minds of
machines as well as in brain and

5046
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:31,930
machines as well as in brain and
 

5047
01:23:31,930 --> 01:23:33,450
machines as well as in brain and
cognitive science yeah we I have a

5048
01:23:33,450 --> 01:23:33,460
cognitive science yeah we I have a
 

5049
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:35,340
cognitive science yeah we I have a
number of colleagues who study the

5050
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:35,350
number of colleagues who study the
 

5051
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:37,050
number of colleagues who study the
actual hardware basis of this stuff in

5052
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:37,060
actual hardware basis of this stuff in
 

5053
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:38,850
actual hardware basis of this stuff in
the brain and that includes like the

5054
01:23:38,850 --> 01:23:38,860
the brain and that includes like the
 

5055
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:40,200
the brain and that includes like the
large-scale architecture of the brain

5056
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:40,210
large-scale architecture of the brain
 

5057
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:41,640
large-scale architecture of the brain
say like what Nancy kanwisher

5058
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:41,650
say like what Nancy kanwisher
 

5059
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:43,380
say like what Nancy kanwisher
Rebecca Saxe studied with functional

5060
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:43,390
Rebecca Saxe studied with functional
 

5061
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:44,729
Rebecca Saxe studied with functional
brain imaging or the more detailed

5062
01:23:44,729 --> 01:23:44,739
brain imaging or the more detailed
 

5063
01:23:44,739 --> 01:23:46,140
brain imaging or the more detailed
circuitry which usually requires

5064
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:46,150
circuitry which usually requires
 

5065
01:23:46,150 --> 01:23:48,540
circuitry which usually requires
recording from say non-human brains

5066
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:48,550
recording from say non-human brains
 

5067
01:23:48,550 --> 01:23:49,890
recording from say non-human brains
right at the level of individual neurons

5068
01:23:49,890 --> 01:23:49,900
right at the level of individual neurons
 

5069
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:51,510
right at the level of individual neurons
and connections between neurons all

5070
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:51,520
and connections between neurons all
 

5071
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:53,610
and connections between neurons all
right so I'm very interested in those

5072
01:23:53,610 --> 01:23:53,620
right so I'm very interested in those
 

5073
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:55,050
right so I'm very interested in those
things although it's not mostly what I

5074
01:23:55,050 --> 01:23:55,060
things although it's not mostly what I
 

5075
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:57,450
things although it's not mostly what I
work on right but I would say you know

5076
01:23:57,450 --> 01:23:57,460
work on right but I would say you know
 

5077
01:23:57,460 --> 01:23:59,040
work on right but I would say you know
again liking in many other areas of

5078
01:23:59,040 --> 01:23:59,050
again liking in many other areas of
 

5079
01:23:59,050 --> 01:24:01,350
again liking in many other areas of
science certainly in neuroscience the

5080
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:01,360
science certainly in neuroscience the
 

5081
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,180
science certainly in neuroscience the
kind of work I'm talking about here in a

5082
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:03,190
kind of work I'm talking about here in a
 

5083
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:04,860
kind of work I'm talking about here in a
sort of classic reductionist program

5084
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:04,870
sort of classic reductionist program
 

5085
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:07,229
sort of classic reductionist program
sets the target for what we might look

5086
01:24:07,229 --> 01:24:07,239
sets the target for what we might look
 

5087
01:24:07,239 --> 01:24:09,180
sets the target for what we might look
for like if I if I just want to go I

5088
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:09,190
for like if I if I just want to go I
 

5089
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:11,850
for like if I if I just want to go I
mean I I would I would I would assert

5090
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:11,860
mean I I would I would I would assert
 

5091
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:14,610
mean I I would I would I would assert
right or my working conjecture is that

5092
01:24:14,610 --> 01:24:14,620
right or my working conjecture is that
 

5093
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:17,160
right or my working conjecture is that
if if you do the kind of work that I'm

5094
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:17,170
if if you do the kind of work that I'm
 

5095
01:24:17,170 --> 01:24:19,080
if if you do the kind of work that I'm
talking about here it gives you the

5096
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:19,090
talking about here it gives you the
 

5097
01:24:19,090 --> 01:24:20,880
talking about here it gives you the
right targets or gives you a candidate

5098
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:20,890
right targets or gives you a candidate
 

5099
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:23,100
right targets or gives you a candidate
set of targets to look for what are the

5100
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:23,110
set of targets to look for what are the
 

5101
01:24:23,110 --> 01:24:25,560
set of targets to look for what are the
neural circuits computing right whereas

5102
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:25,570
neural circuits computing right whereas
 

5103
01:24:25,570 --> 01:24:28,229
neural circuits computing right whereas
if you just go in and just say

5104
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:28,239
if you just go in and just say
 

5105
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:30,720
if you just go in and just say
poking around in the brain or have some

5106
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:30,730
poking around in the brain or have some
 

5107
01:24:30,730 --> 01:24:32,129
poking around in the brain or have some
idea that what you're gonna try to do is

5108
01:24:32,129 --> 01:24:32,139
idea that what you're gonna try to do is
 

5109
01:24:32,139 --> 01:24:33,479
idea that what you're gonna try to do is
find the neural circuits which underlie

5110
01:24:33,479 --> 01:24:33,489
find the neural circuits which underlie
 

5111
01:24:33,489 --> 01:24:35,640
find the neural circuits which underlie
behavior without a sense of the

5112
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:35,650
behavior without a sense of the
 

5113
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:37,919
behavior without a sense of the
computations needed to produce those

5114
01:24:37,919 --> 01:24:37,929
computations needed to produce those
 

5115
01:24:37,929 --> 01:24:40,020
computations needed to produce those
behaviors I don't I think it's gonna be

5116
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:40,030
behaviors I don't I think it's gonna be
 

5117
01:24:40,030 --> 01:24:42,390
behaviors I don't I think it's gonna be
very difficult to eat to know what to

5118
01:24:42,390 --> 01:24:42,400
very difficult to eat to know what to
 

5119
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:43,709
very difficult to eat to know what to
look for and to know when you've found

5120
01:24:43,709 --> 01:24:43,719
look for and to know when you've found
 

5121
01:24:43,719 --> 01:24:46,620
look for and to know when you've found
even viable answers so I think that's

5122
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:46,630
even viable answers so I think that's
 

5123
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:48,060
even viable answers so I think that's
you know that's the standard kind of

5124
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:48,070
you know that's the standard kind of
 

5125
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:51,569
you know that's the standard kind of
reductionist program but it's not that's

5126
01:24:51,569 --> 01:24:51,579
reductionist program but it's not that's
 

5127
01:24:51,579 --> 01:24:54,450
reductionist program but it's not that's
it's not I also think it's it's not one

5128
01:24:54,450 --> 01:24:54,460
it's not I also think it's it's not one
 

5129
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:56,370
it's not I also think it's it's not one
that is I'm divorced from the study of

5130
01:24:56,370 --> 01:24:56,380
that is I'm divorced from the study of
 

5131
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:58,379
that is I'm divorced from the study of
neural circuits it's also one if you

5132
01:24:58,379 --> 01:24:58,389
neural circuits it's also one if you
 

5133
01:24:58,389 --> 01:25:00,000
neural circuits it's also one if you
look at the broad picture of reverse

5134
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:00,010
look at the broad picture of reverse
 

5135
01:25:00,010 --> 01:25:03,180

role okay I would say the mate as an

5142
01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:09,940
role okay I would say the mate as an
 

5143
01:25:09,940 --> 01:25:11,430
role okay I would say the mate as an
when you look at the brain at the

5144
01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:11,440
when you look at the brain at the
 

5145
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,680
when you look at the brain at the
hardware level as an engineer I'm mostly

5146
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:13,690
hardware level as an engineer I'm mostly
 

5147
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:14,910
hardware level as an engineer I'm mostly
looking at the software level right but

5148
01:25:14,910 --> 01:25:14,920
looking at the software level right but
 

5149
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:15,899
looking at the software level right but
when you look at the hardware level

5150
01:25:15,899 --> 01:25:15,909
when you look at the hardware level
 

5151
01:25:15,909 --> 01:25:18,720
when you look at the hardware level
there are some remarkable properties one

5152
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:18,730
there are some remarkable properties one
 

5153
01:25:18,730 --> 01:25:20,430
there are some remarkable properties one
remarkable property again is you know

5154
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:20,440
remarkable property again is you know
 

5155
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:22,200

how much parallelism there is and in

5156
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:22,210
how much parallelism there is and in
 

5157
01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:24,270
how much parallelism there is and in
many ways how fast the computations are

5158
01:25:24,270 --> 01:25:24,280
many ways how fast the computations are
 

5159
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:24,779
many ways how fast the computations are
okay

5160
01:25:24,779 --> 01:25:24,789
okay
 

5161
01:25:24,789 --> 01:25:26,879
okay
neurons are slow but the computations

5162
01:25:26,879 --> 01:25:26,889
neurons are slow but the computations
 

5163
01:25:26,889 --> 01:25:28,739
neurons are slow but the computations
intelligence are very fast so how do we

5164
01:25:28,739 --> 01:25:28,749
intelligence are very fast so how do we
 

5165
01:25:28,749 --> 01:25:30,899
intelligence are very fast so how do we
get elements that are in some sense

5166
01:25:30,899 --> 01:25:30,909
get elements that are in some sense
 

5167
01:25:30,909 --> 01:25:32,879
get elements that are in some sense
quite slow in their time constant to

5168
01:25:32,879 --> 01:25:32,889
quite slow in their time constant to
 

5169
01:25:32,889 --> 01:25:34,470
quite slow in their time constant to
produce such intelligent behavior so

5170
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:34,480
produce such intelligent behavior so
 

5171
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:35,970
produce such intelligent behavior so
quickly that's a great mystery and I

5172
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:35,980
quickly that's a great mystery and I
 

5173
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:37,560
quickly that's a great mystery and I
think if we understood that it would

5174
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:37,570
think if we understood that it would
 

5175
01:25:37,570 --> 01:25:39,359
think if we understood that it would
have payoff for building all sorts of

embedded circuits okay but also maybe

5180
01:25:44,370 --> 01:25:44,380
embedded circuits okay but also maybe
 

5181
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:46,080

most important is the power consumption

5182
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:46,090
most important is the power consumption
 

5183
01:25:46,090 --> 01:25:48,450
most important is the power consumption
and again many people have-have have

5184
01:25:48,450 --> 01:25:48,460
and again many people have-have have
 

5185
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:50,250
and again many people have-have have
noted this right if you look at the

5186
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:50,260
noted this right if you look at the
 

5187
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:51,839
noted this right if you look at the
power consumption the power that the

01:27:39,330 --> 01:27:41,480
computing in a sort of a brain like way
that might lead to possibly even like

5290
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:41,490
that might lead to possibly even like
 

5291
01:27:41,490 --> 01:27:43,130
that might lead to possibly even like
the ability to build something this is

5292
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:43,140
the ability to build something this is
 

5293
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:45,140
the ability to build something this is
Joe's dream to built in this about the

5294
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:45,150
Joe's dream to built in this about the
 

5295
01:27:45,150 --> 01:27:46,430
Joe's dream to built in this about the
size of this table but that has a

5296
01:27:46,430 --> 01:27:46,440
size of this table but that has a
 

5297
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:49,040
size of this table but that has a
billion course a billion cores and runs

5298
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:49,050
billion course a billion cores and runs
 

5299
01:27:49,050 --> 01:27:50,480
billion course a billion cores and runs
on a reasonable kind of power

5300
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:50,490
on a reasonable kind of power
 

5301
01:27:50,490 --> 01:27:52,190
on a reasonable kind of power
consumption I would love to have such a

5302
01:27:52,190 --> 01:27:52,200
consumption I would love to have such a
 

5303
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,890
consumption I would love to have such a
machine if anybody wants to help Joe

5304
01:27:54,890 --> 01:27:54,900
machine if anybody wants to help Joe
 

5305
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:56,150
machine if anybody wants to help Joe
build it I think he'd love to talk to

5306
01:27:56,150 --> 01:27:56,160
build it I think he'd love to talk to
 

5307
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:58,700
build it I think he'd love to talk to
you but that's it's one of a number of

5308
01:27:58,700 --> 01:27:58,710
you but that's it's one of a number of
 

5309
01:27:58,710 --> 01:28:01,400
you but that's it's one of a number of
ideas I mean Google X people are working

5310
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:01,410
ideas I mean Google X people are working
 

5311
01:28:01,410 --> 01:28:03,290
ideas I mean Google X people are working
on similar things probably most of the

5312
01:28:03,290 --> 01:28:03,300
on similar things probably most of the
 

5313
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:05,180
on similar things probably most of the
major chip companies are also inspired

5314
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:05,190
major chip companies are also inspired
 

5315
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:07,700
major chip companies are also inspired
by this idea and I think even if you

5316
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:07,710
by this idea and I think even if you
 

5317
01:28:07,710 --> 01:28:08,780
by this idea and I think even if you
don't didn't think you were interested

5318
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:08,790
don't didn't think you were interested
 

5319
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:10,820
don't didn't think you were interested
in the brain if you want to build the

5320
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:10,830
in the brain if you want to build the
 

5321
01:28:10,830 --> 01:28:12,620
in the brain if you want to build the
kind of AI were talking about and run it

5322
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:12,630
kind of AI were talking about and run it
 

5323
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:14,270
kind of AI were talking about and run it
on physical Hardware of any sort and

5324
01:28:14,270 --> 01:28:14,280
on physical Hardware of any sort and
 

5325
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:16,400
on physical Hardware of any sort and
understanding how the brain circuits

5326
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:16,410
understanding how the brain circuits
 

5327
01:28:16,410 --> 01:28:19,040
understanding how the brain circuits
compute what they do what what I'm

5328
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:19,050
compute what they do what what I'm
 

5329
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:21,080
compute what they do what what I'm
talking about with as little power as

5330
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:21,090
talking about with as little power as
 

5331
01:28:21,090 --> 01:28:23,450
talking about with as little power as
they do I don't know any better place to

5332
01:28:23,450 --> 01:28:23,460
they do I don't know any better place to
 

5333
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:26,000
they do I don't know any better place to
look it seems like a lot of the

5334
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:26,010
look it seems like a lot of the
 

5335
01:28:26,010 --> 01:28:28,100
look it seems like a lot of the
improvements in AI have been driven by

5336
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:28,110
improvements in AI have been driven by
 

5337
01:28:28,110 --> 01:28:30,770
improvements in AI have been driven by
increasing like computational power yeah

5338
01:28:30,770 --> 01:28:30,780
increasing like computational power yeah
 

5339
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:32,960
increasing like computational power yeah
how far you would you say me like GPUs

5340
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:32,970
how far you would you say me like GPUs
 

5341
01:28:32,970 --> 01:28:35,540
how far you would you say me like GPUs
or CMU yeah yeah how far would you say

5342
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:35,550
or CMU yeah yeah how far would you say
 

5343
01:28:35,550 --> 01:28:37,130
or CMU yeah yeah how far would you say
we are from hardware that could run a

5344
01:28:37,130 --> 01:28:37,140
we are from hardware that could run a
 

5345
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:40,790
we are from hardware that could run a
general artificial intelligence of the

5346
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:40,800
general artificial intelligence of the
 

5347
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,440
general artificial intelligence of the
kind that I'm talking about yeah I don't

5348
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:42,450
kind that I'm talking about yeah I don't
 

5349
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:44,180
kind that I'm talking about yeah I don't
know I'll start with a billion cores and

5350
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:44,190
know I'll start with a billion cores and
 

5351
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:47,180
know I'll start with a billion cores and
then we'll see I mean I I think we're I

5352
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:47,190
then we'll see I mean I I think we're I
 

5353
01:28:47,190 --> 01:28:48,770
then we'll see I mean I I think we're I
think we're I mean I think I think

5354
01:28:48,770 --> 01:28:48,780
think we're I mean I think I think
 

5355
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:49,970
think we're I mean I think I think
there's no way to answer that question

5356
01:28:49,970 --> 01:28:49,980
there's no way to answer that question
 

5357
01:28:49,980 --> 01:28:51,980
there's no way to answer that question
in a way that software independent I

5358
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:51,990
in a way that software independent I
 

5359
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:54,650
in a way that software independent I
don't know how to do that right but I

5360
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:54,660
don't know how to do that right but I
 

5361
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:56,330
don't know how to do that right but I
think that

5362
01:28:56,330 --> 01:28:56,340
think that
 

5363
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:59,850
think that
it's and and you know I don't know like

5364
01:28:59,850 --> 01:28:59,860
it's and and you know I don't know like
 

5365
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:01,379
it's and and you know I don't know like
when you say how far are we

5366
01:29:01,379 --> 01:29:01,389
when you say how far are we
 

5367
01:29:01,389 --> 01:29:03,060
when you say how far are we
you mean how far am i with the resources

5368
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:03,070
you mean how far am i with the resources
 

5369
01:29:03,070 --> 01:29:05,160
you mean how far am i with the resources
I have right now how far am i if if

5370
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:05,170
I have right now how far am i if if
 

5371
01:29:05,170 --> 01:29:06,780
I have right now how far am i if if
Google decides to put all of its

5372
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:06,790
Google decides to put all of its
 

5373
01:29:06,790 --> 01:29:08,760
Google decides to put all of its
resources at my disposal like they might

5374
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:08,770
resources at my disposal like they might
 

5375
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:10,140
resources at my disposal like they might
if I were working at deepmind

5376
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:10,150
if I were working at deepmind
 

5377
01:29:10,150 --> 01:29:13,020
if I were working at deepmind
I don't know the answer to that question

5378
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:13,030
I don't know the answer to that question
 

5379
01:29:13,030 --> 01:29:15,660
I don't know the answer to that question
I but I think the I think what we can

5380
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:15,670
I but I think the I think what we can
 

5381
01:29:15,670 --> 01:29:18,510
I but I think the I think what we can
say is this um individual neurons I mean

5382
01:29:18,510 --> 01:29:18,520
say is this um individual neurons I mean
 

5383
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:20,100
say is this um individual neurons I mean
again this goes back to another reason

5384
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:20,110
again this goes back to another reason
 

5385
01:29:20,110 --> 01:29:22,050
again this goes back to another reason
to study neural circuits um if you look

5386
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:22,060
to study neural circuits um if you look
 

5387
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:23,339
to study neural circuits um if you look
at what we currently call neural

5388
01:29:23,339 --> 01:29:23,349
at what we currently call neural
 

5389
01:29:23,349 --> 01:29:25,859
at what we currently call neural
networks in the AI side the model of a

5390
01:29:25,859 --> 01:29:25,869
networks in the AI side the model of a
 

5391
01:29:25,869 --> 01:29:27,660
networks in the AI side the model of a
neuron is this very very simple thing

5392
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:27,670
neuron is this very very simple thing
 

5393
01:29:27,670 --> 01:29:30,000
neuron is this very very simple thing
right individual neurons are not only

5394
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:30,010
right individual neurons are not only
 

5395
01:29:30,010 --> 01:29:31,740
right individual neurons are not only
much more complex but have a lot more

5396
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:31,750
much more complex but have a lot more
 

5397
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:33,870
much more complex but have a lot more
computational power it's not clear how

5398
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:33,880
computational power it's not clear how
 

5399
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:36,030
computational power it's not clear how
they use it or whether they use it but I

5400
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:36,040
they use it or whether they use it but I
 

5401
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:38,189
they use it or whether they use it but I
think it's just as likely that a neuron

5402
01:29:38,189 --> 01:29:38,199
think it's just as likely that a neuron
 

5403
01:29:38,199 --> 01:29:40,260
think it's just as likely that a neuron
is something like a rail you write is

5404
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:40,270
is something like a rail you write is
 

5405
01:29:40,270 --> 01:29:41,430
is something like a rail you write is
that a neuron is something like a

5406
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:41,440
that a neuron is something like a
 

5407
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:43,439
that a neuron is something like a
computer like under one neuron in your

5408
01:29:43,439 --> 01:29:43,449
computer like under one neuron in your
 

5409
01:29:43,449 --> 01:29:46,800
computer like under one neuron in your
brain is more like a CPU node okay maybe

5410
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:46,810
brain is more like a CPU node okay maybe
 

5411
01:29:46,810 --> 01:29:50,520
brain is more like a CPU node okay maybe
and thus the ten billion or trillion you

5412
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:50,530
and thus the ten billion or trillion you
 

5413
01:29:50,530 --> 01:29:52,260
and thus the ten billion or trillion you
know the large number of neurons in your

5414
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:52,270
know the large number of neurons in your
 

5415
01:29:52,270 --> 01:29:55,109
know the large number of neurons in your
brain I think it's like 10 billion

5416
01:29:55,109 --> 01:29:55,119
brain I think it's like 10 billion
 

5417
01:29:55,119 --> 01:29:57,149
brain I think it's like 10 billion
cortical pyramidal neurons or something

5418
01:29:57,149 --> 01:29:57,159
cortical pyramidal neurons or something
 

5419
01:29:57,159 --> 01:30:00,089
cortical pyramidal neurons or something
might be like 10 billion cores okay for

5420
01:30:00,089 --> 01:30:00,099
might be like 10 billion cores okay for
 

5421
01:30:00,099 --> 01:30:01,500
might be like 10 billion cores okay for
example that's at least as plausible I

5422
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:01,510
example that's at least as plausible I
 

5423
01:30:01,510 --> 01:30:03,629
example that's at least as plausible I
think to me as any other estimate so and

5424
01:30:03,629 --> 01:30:03,639
think to me as any other estimate so and
 

5425
01:30:03,639 --> 01:30:05,550
think to me as any other estimate so and
I think so I think we're on the

5426
01:30:05,550 --> 01:30:05,560
I think so I think we're on the
 

5427
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:07,500
I think so I think we're on the
definitely on the underside with very

5428
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:07,510
definitely on the underside with very
 

5429
01:30:07,510 --> 01:30:09,569
definitely on the underside with very
big error bars so I completely agree

5430
01:30:09,569 --> 01:30:09,579
big error bars so I completely agree
 

5431
01:30:09,579 --> 01:30:11,850
big error bars so I completely agree
that or if this is what you might be

5432
01:30:11,850 --> 01:30:11,860
that or if this is what you might be
 

5433
01:30:11,860 --> 01:30:13,950
that or if this is what you might be
suggesting and may you know going back

5434
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:13,960
suggesting and may you know going back
 

5435
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:15,180
suggesting and may you know going back
to my answer to your question I don't

5436
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:15,190
to my answer to your question I don't
 

5437
01:30:15,190 --> 01:30:16,200
to my answer to your question I don't
think we're gonna get to what I'm

5438
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:16,210
think we're gonna get to what I'm
 

5439
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:17,669
think we're gonna get to what I'm
talking about that anything like a real

5440
01:30:17,669 --> 01:30:17,679
talking about that anything like a real
 

5441
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:20,700
talking about that anything like a real
brain scale without major innovations on

5442
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:20,710
brain scale without major innovations on
 

5443
01:30:20,710 --> 01:30:22,620
brain scale without major innovations on
the hardware side and you know it's it's

5444
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:22,630
the hardware side and you know it's it's
 

5445
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:23,910
the hardware side and you know it's it's
interesting that what drove those

01:30:23,910 --> 01:30:23,920
interesting that what drove those
 

5447
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:26,729
interesting that what drove those
innovations in that support current a I

on the circuit level is different but at
 

5521
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:43,379

the what level on the circuit level well
 

5523
01:31:43,389 --> 01:31:45,300
the what level on the circuit level well
of course it's different right but

of course it's different right but
 

5525
01:31:45,310 --> 01:31:47,069
of course it's different right but
already you I think you made a mistake

01:31:47,069 --> 01:31:47,079
already you I think you made a mistake
 

5527
01:31:47,079 --> 01:31:48,930
already you I think you made a mistake
there honestly like you said the

5528
01:31:48,930 --> 01:31:48,940
there honestly like you said the

01:31:51,629 --> 01:31:51,639
predict but I'm not sure what you mean
 

5533
01:31:51,639 --> 01:31:52,890

by that there's many things you could

01:31:52,890 --> 01:31:52,900
by that there's many things you could
 

5535
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:54,419
by that there's many things you could
mean and are what our cognitive science

5536
01:31:54,419 --> 01:31:54,429
mean and are what our cognitive science
 

5537
01:31:54,429 --> 01:31:55,560
mean and are what our cognitive science
is about is learning which of those

5538
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:55,570
is about is learning which of those
 

5539
01:31:55,570 --> 01:31:56,879
is about is learning which of those
versions like I don't think it's

5540
01:31:56,879 --> 01:31:56,889
versions like I don't think it's
 

5541
01:31:56,889 --> 01:31:57,839
versions like I don't think it's
learning how to predict

5542
01:31:57,839 --> 01:31:57,849
learning how to predict
 

5543
01:31:57,849 --> 01:31:59,310
learning how to predict
I think it's learning what you need to

5544
01:31:59,310 --> 01:31:59,320
I think it's learning what you need to
 

5545
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:01,350
I think it's learning what you need to
know to plan actions and to a map you

01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:01,360
know to plan actions and to a map you
 

5547
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:02,490
know to plan actions and to a map you
know all those things like it's not just

5548
01:32:02,490 --> 01:32:02,500
know all those things like it's not just
 

5549
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:04,770
know all those things like it's not just
about predicting it's because there are

5550
01:32:04,770 --> 01:32:04,780
about predicting it's because there are
 

5551
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:06,270
about predicting it's because there are
things we can imagine so that you would

01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:06,280
things we can imagine so that you would
 

5553
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:08,399
things we can imagine so that you would
never predict because there never happen

5554
01:32:08,399 --> 01:32:08,409
never predict because there never happen
 

5555
01:32:08,409 --> 01:32:09,959

different so generalizations are you're

5558
01:32:11,850 --> 01:32:11,860
different so generalizations are you're
 

5559
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:13,410
different so generalizations are you're
not predicting okay when your model

01:32:26,770 --> 01:32:28,770

do it the way a Bayesian model does for
 

5577
01:32:30,579 --> 01:32:31,919
do it the way a Bayesian model does for
sure because that's in the abstract

5579
01:32:31,929 --> 01:32:34,850

level well I mean how do you really know

5580
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:34,860
level well I mean how do you really know
 

5581
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:36,839
level well I mean how do you really know
like and what does it mean to say that

5582
01:32:36,839 --> 01:32:36,849
like and what does it mean to say that
 

5583
01:32:36,849 --> 01:32:39,450
like and what does it mean to say that
some neurons do it like so maybe another

5584
01:32:39,450 --> 01:32:39,460
some neurons do it like so maybe another
 

5585
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:40,919
some neurons do it like so maybe another
way to put this is to say look we have a

5586
01:32:40,919 --> 01:32:40,929
way to put this is to say look we have a
 

5587
01:32:40,929 --> 01:32:42,870
way to put this is to say look we have a
certain math that we use to capture

01:32:42,870 --> 01:32:42,880
certain math that we use to capture
 

5589
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,850
certain math that we use to capture
these you could call it abstract I call

01:32:44,850 --> 01:32:44,860
these you could call it abstract I call
 

5591
01:32:44,860 --> 01:32:47,100
these you could call it abstract I call
it software level abstractions right I

01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:52,530
kind of abstraction but you might have a
circuit level abstraction a certain kind

5598
01:32:52,530 --> 01:32:52,540
circuit level abstraction a certain kind
 

5599
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:53,729
circuit level abstraction a certain kind
of hardware level that you're interested

5600
01:32:53,729 --> 01:32:53,739
of hardware level that you're interested
 

5601
01:32:53,739 --> 01:32:55,709
of hardware level that you're interested
in describing the brain at and I'm

5602
01:32:55,709 --> 01:32:55,719
in describing the brain at and I'm
 

5603
01:32:55,719 --> 01:32:57,359
in describing the brain at and I'm
mostly working out or starting from a

5604
01:32:57,359 --> 01:32:57,369
mostly working out or starting from a
 

5605
01:32:57,369 --> 01:32:58,950
mostly working out or starting from a
more software level of abstraction right

5606
01:32:58,950 --> 01:32:58,960
more software level of abstraction right
 

5607
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:00,000
more software level of abstraction right
they're all distractions we're not

5608
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:00,010
they're all distractions we're not
 

5609
01:33:00,010 --> 01:33:02,100
they're all distractions we're not
talking about molecules here right we're

5610
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:02,110
talking about molecules here right we're
 

5611
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:03,750
talking about molecules here right we're
talking about some abstract notion of

5612
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:03,760
talking about some abstract notion of
 

5613
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:06,120
talking about some abstract notion of
maybe a circuit or of a program okay

5614
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:06,130
maybe a circuit or of a program okay
 

5615
01:33:06,130 --> 01:33:07,830
maybe a circuit or of a program okay
right now it's a really interesting

5616
01:33:07,830 --> 01:33:07,840
right now it's a really interesting
 

5617
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:10,109
right now it's a really interesting
question if I look at some circuits how

5618
01:33:10,109 --> 01:33:10,119
question if I look at some circuits how
 

5619
01:33:10,119 --> 01:33:11,790
question if I look at some circuits how
do I know what program they're

5620
01:33:11,790 --> 01:33:11,800
do I know what program they're
 

5621
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:12,930
do I know what program they're
implementing right if I look at the

5622
01:33:12,930 --> 01:33:12,940
implementing right if I look at the
 

5623
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:14,250
implementing right if I look at the
circuits in this machine could I tell

5624
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:14,260
circuits in this machine could I tell
 

5625
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:15,720
circuits in this machine could I tell
what program they're implementing well

5626
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:15,730
what program they're implementing well
 

5627
01:33:15,730 --> 01:33:17,280
what program they're implementing well
maybe but certainly it would be a lot

5628
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:17,290
maybe but certainly it would be a lot
 

5629
01:33:17,290 --> 01:33:18,569
maybe but certainly it would be a lot
easier if I knew something about what

5630
01:33:18,569 --> 01:33:18,579
easier if I knew something about what
 

5631
01:33:18,579 --> 01:33:19,410
easier if I knew something about what
programs they might

5632
01:33:19,410 --> 01:33:19,420
programs they might
 

5633
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:20,790
programs they might
implementing before I start to look at

5634
01:33:20,790 --> 01:33:20,800
implementing before I start to look at
 

5635
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,050
implementing before I start to look at
the circuitry if I just looked at the

5636
01:33:22,050 --> 01:33:22,060
the circuitry if I just looked at the
 

5637
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:24,660
the circuitry if I just looked at the
circuitry without knowing what a program

5638
01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:24,670
circuitry without knowing what a program
 

5639
01:33:24,670 --> 01:33:26,459
circuitry without knowing what a program
was or what programs the thing might be

5640
01:33:26,459 --> 01:33:26,469
was or what programs the thing might be
 

5641
01:33:26,469 --> 01:33:28,169
was or what programs the thing might be
doing or what kind of programming

5642
01:33:28,169 --> 01:33:28,179
doing or what kind of programming
 

5643
01:33:28,179 --> 01:33:30,990
doing or what kind of programming
components would be mapable to circuits

5644
01:33:30,990 --> 01:33:31,000
components would be mapable to circuits
 

5645
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,419
components would be mapable to circuits
in different ways right I don't even

5646
01:33:33,419 --> 01:33:33,429
in different ways right I don't even
 

5647
01:33:33,429 --> 01:33:34,500
in different ways right I don't even
know how to begin to answer that

5648
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:34,510
know how to begin to answer that
 

5649
01:33:34,510 --> 01:33:35,100
know how to begin to answer that
question

5650
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:35,110
question
 

5651
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:36,600
question
so I think you know we've made some

5652
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:36,610
so I think you know we've made some
 

5653
01:33:36,610 --> 01:33:39,030
so I think you know we've made some
progress at understanding what neurons

5654
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:39,040
progress at understanding what neurons
 

5655
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,220
progress at understanding what neurons
are doing in certain low-level parts of

5656
01:33:41,220 --> 01:33:41,230
are doing in certain low-level parts of
 

5657
01:33:41,230 --> 01:33:43,140
are doing in certain low-level parts of
sensory system and certain parts of the

5658
01:33:43,140 --> 01:33:43,150
sensory system and certain parts of the
 

5659
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:44,580
sensory system and certain parts of the
motor system like primary motor cortex

5660
01:33:44,580 --> 01:33:44,590
motor system like primary motor cortex
 

5661
01:33:44,590 --> 01:33:46,470
motor system like primary motor cortex
like basically the parts of the neurons

5662
01:33:46,470 --> 01:33:46,480
like basically the parts of the neurons
 

5663
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:47,760
like basically the parts of the neurons
that are closest to the inputs and

5664
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:47,770
that are closest to the inputs and
 

5665
01:33:47,770 --> 01:33:50,100
that are closest to the inputs and
outputs of the brain right where we

5666
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:50,110
outputs of the brain right where we
 

5667
01:33:50,110 --> 01:33:52,620
outputs of the brain right where we
don't eat when you can say we don't need

5668
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:52,630
don't eat when you can say we don't need
 

5669
01:33:52,630 --> 01:33:54,840
don't eat when you can say we don't need
the kind of software abstractions that

5670
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:54,850
the kind of software abstractions that
 

5671
01:33:54,850 --> 01:33:57,510
the kind of software abstractions that
I'm talking about or where we sort of

5672
01:33:57,510 --> 01:33:57,520
I'm talking about or where we sort of
 

5673
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:59,010
I'm talking about or where we sort of
agree on what those things already are

5674
01:33:59,010 --> 01:33:59,020
agree on what those things already are
 

5675
01:33:59,020 --> 01:34:00,900
agree on what those things already are
so we can make enough progress on

5676
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:00,910
so we can make enough progress on
 

5677
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:02,669
so we can make enough progress on
knowing what to look for and how to how

5678
01:34:02,669 --> 01:34:02,679
knowing what to look for and how to how
 

5679
01:34:02,679 --> 01:34:04,439
knowing what to look for and how to how
to know when we found it but if you want

5680
01:34:04,439 --> 01:34:04,449
to know when we found it but if you want
 

5681
01:34:04,449 --> 01:34:06,300
to know when we found it but if you want
to talk about flexible planning things

5682
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:06,310
to talk about flexible planning things
 

5683
01:34:06,310 --> 01:34:07,650
to talk about flexible planning things
that are more like cognition that you

5684
01:34:07,650 --> 01:34:07,660
that are more like cognition that you
 

5685
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:10,740
that are more like cognition that you
know go on in prefrontal cortex right I

5686
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:10,750
know go on in prefrontal cortex right I
 

5687
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:12,900
know go on in prefrontal cortex right I
this point I don't I don't think that

5688
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:12,910
this point I don't I don't think that
 

5689
01:34:12,910 --> 01:34:14,430
this point I don't I don't think that
just by recording from those neurons

5690
01:34:14,430 --> 01:34:14,440
just by recording from those neurons
 

5691
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:15,810
just by recording from those neurons
we're gonna be able to answer those

5692
01:34:15,810 --> 01:34:15,820
we're gonna be able to answer those
 

5693
01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:17,459
we're gonna be able to answer those
questions in a meaningful engineering

5694
01:34:17,459 --> 01:34:17,469
questions in a meaningful engineering
 

5695
01:34:17,469 --> 01:34:19,680
questions in a meaningful engineering
way a way that that any engineer

5696
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:19,690
way a way that that any engineer
 

5697
01:34:19,690 --> 01:34:21,600
way a way that that any engineer
software a hardware whatever could

5698
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:21,610
software a hardware whatever could
 

5699
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:23,100
software a hardware whatever could
really say yeah okay I get it I get

5700
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:23,110
really say yeah okay I get it I get
 

5701
01:34:23,110 --> 01:34:24,300
really say yeah okay I get it I get
those insights in a way that I can

5702
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:24,310
those insights in a way that I can
 

5703
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:26,160
those insights in a way that I can
engineer with and that's what my goal is

5704
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:26,170
engineer with and that's what my goal is
 

5705
01:34:26,170 --> 01:34:28,050
engineer with and that's what my goal is
right so my goal that's my goal to do at

5706
01:34:28,050 --> 01:34:28,060
right so my goal that's my goal to do at
 

5707
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:29,580
right so my goal that's my goal to do at
the software level the hardware level or

5708
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:29,590
the software level the hardware level or
 

5709
01:34:29,590 --> 01:34:31,439
the software level the hardware level or
the entire systems level connecting them

5710
01:34:31,439 --> 01:34:31,449
the entire systems level connecting them
 

5711
01:34:31,449 --> 01:34:33,870
the entire systems level connecting them
and I think that you know we can do that

5712
01:34:33,870 --> 01:34:33,880
and I think that you know we can do that
 

5713
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,340
and I think that you know we can do that
by taking what we're doing and bringing

5714
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:35,350
by taking what we're doing and bringing
 

5715
01:34:35,350 --> 01:34:36,750
by taking what we're doing and bringing
into contact with people studying neural

5716
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:36,760
into contact with people studying neural
 

5717
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:38,760
into contact with people studying neural
circuits but I don't think you can you

5718
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:38,770
circuits but I don't think you can you
 

5719
01:34:38,770 --> 01:34:40,350
circuits but I don't think you can you
can leave this level out and just go

5720
01:34:40,350 --> 01:34:40,360
can leave this level out and just go
 

5721
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:41,669
can leave this level out and just go
straight to the neural circuits and I

5722
01:34:41,669 --> 01:34:41,679
straight to the neural circuits and I
 

5723
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:42,570
straight to the neural circuits and I
think the more you have the more

5724
01:34:42,570 --> 01:34:42,580
think the more you have the more
 

5725
01:34:42,580 --> 01:34:44,610
think the more you have the more
progress we make the more we can help

5726
01:34:44,610 --> 01:34:44,620
progress we make the more we can help
 

5727
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:46,380
progress we make the more we can help
people who are studying at the neural

5728
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:46,390
people who are studying at the neural
 

5729
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:47,640
people who are studying at the neural
circuit level and they can help us

5730
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:47,650
circuit level and they can help us
 

5731
01:34:47,650 --> 01:34:49,140
circuit level and they can help us
address these other engineering

5732
01:34:49,140 --> 01:34:49,150
address these other engineering
 

5733
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:50,130
address these other engineering
questions that we don't really have

5734
01:34:50,130 --> 01:34:50,140
questions that we don't really have
 

5735
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:52,140
questions that we don't really have
access to like the power issue or the

5736
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:52,150
access to like the power issue or the
 

5737
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:54,689
access to like the power issue or the
speed issue thank you okay thanks that

5738
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:54,699
speed issue thank you okay thanks that
 

5739
01:34:54,699 --> 01:34:56,459
speed issue thank you okay thanks that
was great I thought maybe it'd give

5740
01:34:56,459 --> 01:34:56,469
was great I thought maybe it'd give
 

5741
01:34:56,469 --> 01:34:57,550
was great I thought maybe it'd give
