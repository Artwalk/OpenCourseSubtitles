are doing that and one of the lessons
 

159
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,940
are doing that and one of the lessons
that I learned at Google was that the

that I learned at Google was that the
 

161
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,800
that I learned at Google was that the
world is a very big place there's an

world is a very big place there's an
 

163
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,290
world is a very big place there's an
awful lot of smart people and awful lot

awful lot of smart people and awful lot
 

165
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,840
awful lot of smart people and awful lot
of them are underutilized so here's an

166
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:26,850
of them are underutilized so here's an
 

167
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,780
of them are underutilized so here's an
opportunity for example building parts

168
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:29,790
opportunity for example building parts
 

169
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,820
opportunity for example building parts
of programs building new ideas to

170
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:31,830
of programs building new ideas to
 

171
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,710
of programs building new ideas to
contribute to the greater of society so

contribute to the greater of society so
 

173
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,930
contribute to the greater of society so
in that moment in the seventies the the

174
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:38,940
in that moment in the seventies the the
 

175
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,610
in that moment in the seventies the the
inspiring moment where there was nothing

176
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:40,620
inspiring moment where there was nothing
 

177
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,080
inspiring moment where there was nothing
and then you created something through

178
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,090
and then you created something through
 

179
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,170
and then you created something through
programming that magical moment so in

1975 I think you've created a program
 

183
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,090
1975 I think you've created a program
called Lex which I especially like

computers were being born do you think

200
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,050
computers were being born do you think
 

201
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,839
computers were being born do you think
you'll be able to predict the 80s 90s

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:19,819
and the arts
of what computers would go I'm sure I

206
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:19,829
of what computers would go I'm sure I
 

207
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,529
of what computers would go I'm sure I
could not and would not have gotten it

I was the beneficiary of the great work
 

213
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,439
I was the beneficiary of the great work
of many many people who saw it clearer

of many many people who saw it clearer
 

215
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:30,740
of many many people who saw it clearer
than I did with Lex I worked with a

00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:30,750
than I did with Lex I worked with a
 

217
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,140
than I did with Lex I worked with a
fella named Michael Lesk who was my

after that I worked at Xerox Palo Alto

226
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:40,740
after that I worked at Xerox Palo Alto
 

227
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,100
after that I worked at Xerox Palo Alto
Research Center where the Alto was

228
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,110
Research Center where the Alto was
 

229
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,469
Research Center where the Alto was
invented and the Alto is the predecessor

230
00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:45,479
invented and the Alto is the predecessor
 

231
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,200
invented and the Alto is the predecessor
of the modern personal computer or

232
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,210
of the modern personal computer or
 

233
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,200
of the modern personal computer or
Macintosh and so forth and the Altos

Macintosh and so forth and the Altos
 

235
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,209
Macintosh and so forth and the Altos
were very rare and I had to drive an

236
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:53,219
were very rare and I had to drive an
 

237
00:04:53,219 --> 00:04:55,399
were very rare and I had to drive an
hour from Berkeley to go use them but I

238
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:55,409
hour from Berkeley to go use them but I
 

239
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:57,499
hour from Berkeley to go use them but I
made a point of skipping classes and

240
00:04:57,499 --> 00:04:57,509
made a point of skipping classes and
 

241
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:01,070
made a point of skipping classes and
doing whatever it took to have access to

242
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,080
doing whatever it took to have access to
 

243
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,929
doing whatever it took to have access to
this extraordinary achievement I knew

244
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:02,939
this extraordinary achievement I knew
 

245
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:05,570
this extraordinary achievement I knew
that they were consequential what I did

246
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:05,580
that they were consequential what I did
 

247
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,689
that they were consequential what I did
not understand was scaling I did not

248
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:08,699
not understand was scaling I did not
 

249
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,070
not understand was scaling I did not
understand what would happen when you

250
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
understand what would happen when you
 

251
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,779
understand what would happen when you
had a hundred million as opposed to a

252
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:11,789
had a hundred million as opposed to a
 

253
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:14,570
had a hundred million as opposed to a
hundred and so the since then and I have

254
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:14,580
hundred and so the since then and I have
 

255
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,790
hundred and so the since then and I have
learned the benefit of scale I always

256
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
learned the benefit of scale I always
 

257
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,200
learned the benefit of scale I always
look for things which are going to scale

258
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,210
look for things which are going to scale
 

259
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,869
look for things which are going to scale
to platforms right so mobile phones

260
00:05:20,869 --> 00:05:20,879
to platforms right so mobile phones
 

261
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:23,689
to platforms right so mobile phones
Android all those things there are the

262
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:23,699
Android all those things there are the
 

263
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,329
Android all those things there are the
world is a numerous there are many many

264
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:26,339
world is a numerous there are many many
 

265
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:28,159
world is a numerous there are many many
people in the world people really have

266
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:28,169
people in the world people really have
 

267
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:29,390
people in the world people really have
needs they really will use these

268
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:29,400
needs they really will use these
 

269
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,680
needs they really will use these
platforms and you can build big

270
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:30,690
platforms and you can build big
 

271
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,809
platforms and you can build big
businesses on top of them so it's

272
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:32,819
businesses on top of them so it's
 

273
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:34,129
businesses on top of them so it's
interesting so when you see a piece of

274
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:34,139
interesting so when you see a piece of
 

275
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,110
interesting so when you see a piece of
technology now you think what will this

276
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:36,120
technology now you think what will this
 

277
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,760
technology now you think what will this
technology look like when it's in the

278
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:37,770
technology look like when it's in the
 

279
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,320
technology look like when it's in the
hands of a billion people that's right

280
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:39,330
hands of a billion people that's right
 

281
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,070
hands of a billion people that's right
so an example would be that the market

282
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,080
so an example would be that the market
 

283
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,189
so an example would be that the market
is so competitive now that if you can't

284
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:46,199
is so competitive now that if you can't
 

285
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,019
is so competitive now that if you can't
figure out a way for something to have a

286
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:48,029
figure out a way for something to have a
 

287
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:50,869
figure out a way for something to have a
million users or a billion users it

288
00:05:50,869 --> 00:05:50,879
million users or a billion users it
 

289
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,459
million users or a billion users it
probably is not going to be successful

290
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:52,469
probably is not going to be successful
 

291
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:55,490
probably is not going to be successful
because something else will become the

292
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:55,500
because something else will become the
 

293
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,800
because something else will become the
general platform and your idea will

294
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:57,810
general platform and your idea will
 

295
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,820
general platform and your idea will
become a lost idea or a specialized

296
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:01,830
become a lost idea or a specialized
 

297
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,399
become a lost idea or a specialized
service with relatively few users so

298
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:04,409
service with relatively few users so
 

299
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:06,619
service with relatively few users so
it's a path to generality it's a path to

300
00:06:06,619 --> 00:06:06,629
it's a path to generality it's a path to
 

301
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:08,300
it's a path to generality it's a path to
general platform use it's a path to

302
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:08,310
general platform use it's a path to
 

303
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,579
general platform use it's a path to
broad applicability now there are plenty

304
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:10,589
broad applicability now there are plenty
 

305
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:12,769
broad applicability now there are plenty

of good businesses that are tiny so
 

307
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:15,499
of good businesses that are tiny so
luxury goods for example but if you want

308
00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:15,509
luxury goods for example but if you want
 

309
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:18,980
luxury goods for example but if you want
to have an impact at scale you have to

310
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:18,990
to have an impact at scale you have to
 

311
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,869
to have an impact at scale you have to

about the importance of thinking 5 years
ahead and having a plan for those 5

480
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:41,890
ahead and having a plan for those 5
 

481
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,790
ahead and having a plan for those 5
years the way to say it is that almost

482
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
years the way to say it is that almost
 

483
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,210
years the way to say it is that almost
everybody has a 1 year plan almost no

484
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:48,220
everybody has a 1 year plan almost no
 

485
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,330
everybody has a 1 year plan almost no
one has a proper 5-year plan and the key

486
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:51,340
one has a proper 5-year plan and the key
 

487
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,010
one has a proper 5-year plan and the key
thing to have on a 5-year plan is having

488
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:53,020
thing to have on a 5-year plan is having
 

489
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,320
thing to have on a 5-year plan is having
a model for what's going to happen under

490
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:55,330
a model for what's going to happen under
 

491
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,450
a model for what's going to happen under
the underlying platforms so here's an

492
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:57,460
the underlying platforms so here's an
 

493
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,750
the underlying platforms so here's an
example compute Moore's law as we know

00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:07,630
traditional shrinking mechanism because

00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,410
traditional shrinking mechanism because
the costs have just gotten so high it's

the costs have just gotten so high it's
 

503
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,420
the costs have just gotten so high it's
getting harder and harder but there's

00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:12,430
getting harder and harder but there's
 

505
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,550
getting harder and harder but there's
plenty of algorithmic improvements and

506
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:14,560
plenty of algorithmic improvements and
 

507
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,770
plenty of algorithmic improvements and
specialized Hardware improvements so you

508
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:16,780
specialized Hardware improvements so you
 

509
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,990
specialized Hardware improvements so you
need to understand the nature of those

510
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,000
need to understand the nature of those
 

511
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,060
need to understand the nature of those
improvements and where they'll go in

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:21,070
improvements and where they'll go in
 

513
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,470

were primarily going to be using fiber
 

531
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,200
were primarily going to be using fiber
but now it looks like we're going to be

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,210
but now it looks like we're going to be
 

533
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,810
but now it looks like we're going to be
using fiber plus very powerful high

faster for that reason and so when you
 

553
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,660
faster for that reason and so when you
think about whether there's a fiber or

that's how programmers often think and

00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:38,750
that's how programmers often think and

00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,040
that's how programmers often think and

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,050
slowing things down and saying well this
 

627
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,889
slowing things down and saying well this
is the rational this is the possible the

633
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,110
pragmatist so it's so so it's helpful to
have a model which including encourages

634
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,120
have a model which including encourages
 

635
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,530
have a model which including encourages
a predictable revenue stream as well as

00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:06,310
order to pull this off you have to have
 

695
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,520
order to pull this off you have to have
a bunch of belief systems and one of

a bunch of belief systems and one of
 

697
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,020
a bunch of belief systems and one of
them is that you have to have bottoms up

them is that you have to have bottoms up
 

699
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,990
them is that you have to have bottoms up
and tops down the bottoms up we call 20%

and so there's a there's a there's a lot
of very smart people who are thinking

798
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,010
of very smart people who are thinking
 

799
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,860
of very smart people who are thinking
about the stuff disagreeing which is

800
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:14,870
about the stuff disagreeing which is
 

801
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,890
about the stuff disagreeing which is
really healthy of course so what do you

802
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:17,900
really healthy of course so what do you
 

803
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,510
really healthy of course so what do you
think is the healthiest way for the AI

804
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:19,520
think is the healthiest way for the AI
 

805
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,870
think is the healthiest way for the AI
community to and and really for the

806
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:22,880
community to and and really for the
 

807
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,750
community to and and really for the
general public to think about AI and the

808
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:25,760
general public to think about AI and the
 

809
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,350
general public to think about AI and the
concern of the technology being

810
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:29,360
concern of the technology being
 

811
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,500
concern of the technology being
mismanaged in some in some kind of way

812
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:32,510
mismanaged in some in some kind of way
 

813
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,390
mismanaged in some in some kind of way
so the source of Education for the

814
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:34,400
so the source of Education for the
 

815
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,610
so the source of Education for the
general public has been robot killer

816
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:36,620
general public has been robot killer
 

817
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:41,950
general public has been robot killer
movies right and terminator etc and the

818
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:41,960
movies right and terminator etc and the
 

819
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,570
movies right and terminator etc and the
one thing I can assure you were not

820
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:43,580
one thing I can assure you were not
 

821
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,079
one thing I can assure you were not
building are those kinds of solutions

822
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,089
building are those kinds of solutions
 

823
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,070
building are those kinds of solutions
furthermore if they were to show up

824
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:48,080
furthermore if they were to show up
 

825
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,020
furthermore if they were to show up
someone would notice and unplug them

826
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:50,030
someone would notice and unplug them
 

827
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:53,020
someone would notice and unplug them
right so as exciting as those movies are

828
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,030
right so as exciting as those movies are
 

829
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,360
right so as exciting as those movies are
and they're great movies were the killer

830
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:55,370
and they're great movies were the killer

robots to start we would find a way to

832
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:58,490
robots to start we would find a way to
 

833
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,840
robots to start we would find a way to
to stop them right so I'm not concerned

834
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:01,850
to stop them right so I'm not concerned
 

835
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:05,949
to stop them right so I'm not concerned
about that and much of this has to do

836
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:05,959
about that and much of this has to do
 

837
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,710
about that and much of this has to do
with the time frame of conversation so

838
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:08,720
with the time frame of conversation so
 

839
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,010
with the time frame of conversation so
you can imagine a situation a hundred

840

it's in human centered AI or something
 

1425
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,010
it's in human centered AI or something
else that's the next great startup and

1426
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:10,020
else that's the next great startup and
 

1427
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:14,030
else that's the next great startup and
the psychology of that moment so when

1428
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,040
the psychology of that moment so when
 

1429
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,300
the psychology of that moment so when
Sergey and Larry talk about it

1430
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:17,310
Sergey and Larry talk about it
 

1431
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,220
Sergey and Larry talk about it
in listen to a few interviews it's very

1432
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:19,230
in listen to a few interviews it's very
 

1433
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:22,220
in listen to a few interviews it's very
nonchalant well here's here's the very

1434
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:22,230
nonchalant well here's here's the very
 

1435
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:26,300
nonchalant well here's here's the very
fascinating web data and here's an

1436
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:26,310
fascinating web data and here's an
 

1437
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,040
fascinating web data and here's an
algorithm we have for you know we just

1438
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,050
algorithm we have for you know we just
 

1439
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,000
algorithm we have for you know we just
kind of want to play around with that

1440
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,010
kind of want to play around with that
 

1441
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,620
kind of want to play around with that
data and it seems like that's a really

1442
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:30,630
data and it seems like that's a really
 

1443
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:33,620
data and it seems like that's a really
nice way to organize this data yeah well

1444
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:33,630
nice way to organize this data yeah well
 

1445
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,090
nice way to organize this data yeah well
I can say I should say what happened

1446
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:35,100
I can say I should say what happened
 

1447
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,650
I can say I should say what happened
remember is that they were graduate

1448
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:36,660
remember is that they were graduate
 

1449
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,540
remember is that they were graduate
students at Stanford and they thought

1450
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:38,550
students at Stanford and they thought
 

1451
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,920
students at Stanford and they thought
there's just interesting so they built a

1452
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:39,930
there's just interesting so they built a
 

1453
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,510
there's just interesting so they built a
search engine and they kept it in their

1454
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:41,520
search engine and they kept it in their
 

1455
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,410
search engine and they kept it in their
room and they had to get power from the

1456
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:45,420
room and they had to get power from the
 

1457
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,940
room and they had to get power from the
room next door because they were using

1458
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:46,950
room next door because they were using
 

1459
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,440
room next door because they were using
too much power in the room so they ran

1460
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:48,450
too much power in the room so they ran
 

1461
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:51,260
too much power in the room so they ran
an extension cord over yeah yeah and

1462
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:51,270
an extension cord over yeah yeah and
 

1463
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,300
an extension cord over yeah yeah and
then they went and they found a house

1464
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:53,310
then they went and they found a house
 

1465
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,920
then they went and they found a house
and they had Google world headquarters

1466
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:54,930
and they had Google world headquarters
 

1467
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:57,140
and they had Google world headquarters
of five people right to start the

1468
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:57,150
of five people right to start the
 

1469
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,250
of five people right to start the
company and they raised a hundred

1470
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:58,260
company and they raised a hundred
 

1471
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,560
company and they raised a hundred
thousand dollars from Andy bechtolsheim

1472
00:29:59,560 --> 00:29:59,570
thousand dollars from Andy bechtolsheim
 

1473

who was the son founder to do this and

1474
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:02,100
who was the son founder to do this and
 

1475
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,850
who was the son founder to do this and
Dave Chariton and a few others the point

1476
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:04,860
Dave Chariton and a few others the point
 

1477
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:08,330
Dave Chariton and a few others the point
is their beginnings were very simple but

1478
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:08,340
is their beginnings were very simple but
 

1479
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,870
is their beginnings were very simple but
they were based on a powerful insight

1480
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:10,880
they were based on a powerful insight
 

1481
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,790
they were based on a powerful insight
that is a replicable model for any

1482
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:13,800
that is a replicable model for any
 

1483
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,220
that is a replicable model for any
startup it has to be a powerful insight

1484
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:16,230
startup it has to be a powerful insight
 

1485
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,020

00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:21,320
the beginnings are simple and there has
