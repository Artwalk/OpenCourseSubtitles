and on a very intuitive level it's easy
 

77
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,130
and on a very intuitive level it's easy
to see what it should be the case if you

00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:01,140
to see what it should be the case if you

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,249
to see what it should be the case if you
have some data and you're able to find a

have some data and you're able to find a

shorter program which generates this
 

83

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,470
this data into your program and then you
can use these objects to make the best

then it means that your data is totally

00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:56,620
you expand the terms iran you do some
 

487
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,800
you expand the terms iran you do some
algebra and you get a derivative and

00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:27,190
there is a different class of
 

513
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,440
there is a different class of
reinforcement learning algorithms which

514
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:28,450
reinforcement learning algorithms which
 

515
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,610
reinforcement learning algorithms which
is a little bit more difficult to

516
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:29,620
is a little bit more difficult to
 

517
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,440
is a little bit more difficult to
explain it's called the Q learning based

518
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:31,450
explain it's called the Q learning based
 

519
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,639
explain it's called the Q learning based
algorithms they are a bit less stable a

520
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:34,649
algorithms they are a bit less stable a
 

521
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:39,389
algorithms they are a bit less stable a
bit more sample efficient and it has the

522
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:39,399
bit more sample efficient and it has the
 

523
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,310
bit more sample efficient and it has the
property that it can learn not only from

524
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:43,320
property that it can learn not only from
 

525
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,590
property that it can learn not only from
the data generated by the actor but from

526
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:46,600
the data generated by the actor but from
 

527
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,420
the data generated by the actor but from
any other data as well so it has it has

528
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:48,430
any other data as well so it has it has
 

529
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,250
any other data as well so it has it has
some rope but it has different

530
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:50,260
some rope but it has different
 

531
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,050
some rope but it has different
robustness profile which would be a

532
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:52,060
robustness profile which would be a
 

533
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,850
robustness profile which would be a
little bit important but it's only going

534
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:53,860
little bit important but it's only going
 

535
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,090
little bit important but it's only going
to be a technicality so yeah this is the

536
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:57,100
to be a technicality so yeah this is the
 

537
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,400
to be a technicality so yeah this is the
own policy of policy distinction but

538
00:11:59,400 --> 00:11:59,410
own policy of policy distinction but
 

539
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,780
own policy of policy distinction but
it's a little bit technical so if you

540
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:00,790
it's a little bit technical so if you
 

541
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,510
it's a little bit technical so if you
find this hard to understand don't worry

542
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:03,520
find this hard to understand don't worry
 

543
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,340
find this hard to understand don't worry
about it if you already know this then

544
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:05,350
about it if you already know this then
 

545
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,819
about it if you already know this then
you already know it so now what's the

546
00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:08,829
you already know it so now what's the
 

547
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:09,990
you already know it so now what's the
potential for enforcement learning

548
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000
potential for enforcement learning
 

549
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,560
potential for enforcement learning
wasn't it promised what is it actually

550
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:12,570
wasn't it promised what is it actually
 

551
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,840
wasn't it promised what is it actually
why should we be excited about it

552
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:15,850
why should we be excited about it
 

553
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,400
why should we be excited about it
now there are two reasons the

554
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:17,410
now there are two reasons the
 

555
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,960
now there are two reasons the
reinforcement learning algorithms of

556
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:18,970
reinforcement learning algorithms of
 

557
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,820
reinforcement learning algorithms of
today already useful and interesting and

558
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:22,830
today already useful and interesting and
 

559
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,600
today already useful and interesting and
especially if you have a really good

560
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:24,610
especially if you have a really good
 

561
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,730
especially if you have a really good
simulation of your world you could train

562
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:26,740
simulation of your world you could train
 

563
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,290
simulation of your world you could train
agents to do lots of interesting things

564
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:30,300

 

565
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,300

but what's really exciting is if you can

566
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:33,310
but what's really exciting is if you can
 

567
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,670
but what's really exciting is if you can
build a super amazing sample efficient

568
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:35,680
build a super amazing sample efficient

we just give it a tiny amount of data
 

573
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,250
we just give it a tiny amount of data
and the algorithm just crunches through

and the algorithm just crunches through
 

575
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,900
and the algorithm just crunches through
it and extracts every bit of entropy out

want to dive into the topic of meta

588
00:12:59,880 --> 00:12:59,890
want to dive into the topic of meta
 

589
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:04,190
want to dive into the topic of meta
learning the goal of meta learning so

590
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:04,200
learning the goal of meta learning so
 

591
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,140
learning the goal of meta learning so
meta learning is a beautiful idea that

592
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:07,150
meta learning is a beautiful idea that
 

593
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,450
meta learning is a beautiful idea that
doesn't really work but it kind of works

594
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:09,460
doesn't really work but it kind of works
 

595
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,880
doesn't really work but it kind of works
and it's really promising too it's

596
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:11,890
and it's really promising too it's
 

597
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,940
and it's really promising too it's
another promising idea so what's the

598
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:14,950
another promising idea so what's the
 

599
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,440
another promising idea so what's the
dream we have some learning algorithms

600
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:18,450
dream we have some learning algorithms
 

601
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,580
dream we have some learning algorithms
perhaps you could use those learning

602
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:20,590
perhaps you could use those learning
 

603
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,790
perhaps you could use those learning
algorithms in order to learn to learn

604
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:22,800
algorithms in order to learn to learn
 

605
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,880
algorithms in order to learn to learn
I'd be nice if we could learn to learn

606
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:25,890
I'd be nice if we could learn to learn
 

607
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:29,190
I'd be nice if we could learn to learn
so how would you do that you will take a

608
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,200
so how would you do that you will take a
 

609
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,230
so how would you do that you will take a
system which you train it not on one

610
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:34,240
system which you train it not on one
 

611
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,870
system which you train it not on one
task but on many tasks and you ask you

612
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:36,880
task but on many tasks and you ask you
 

613
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,070
task but on many tasks and you ask you
that it learns to solve these tasks

614
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:38,080
that it learns to solve these tasks
 

615
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,570
that it learns to solve these tasks
quickly and that may actually be enough

616
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:41,580
quickly and that may actually be enough
 

617
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,680
quickly and that may actually be enough
so here's how it looks like here's how

618
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:43,690
so here's how it looks like here's how
 

619
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,020
so here's how it looks like here's how
most traditional metal earning look

620
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,030
most traditional metal earning look
 

621
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,180
most traditional metal earning look
works like it looks like you have a

622
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:48,190
works like it looks like you have a
 

623
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,090
works like it looks like you have a
model which is a big neural network what

624
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:51,100
model which is a big neural network what
 

625
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,890
model which is a big neural network what
what you do is that you treat every

00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:54,900
what you do is that you treat every
 

627
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,570
what you do is that you treat every
instead of training cases you have

628
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:57,580
instead of training cases you have
 

629
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,760
instead of training cases you have
training tasks and instead of test cases

630
00:13:59,760 --> 00:13:59,770
training tasks and instead of test cases
 

631
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,690
training tasks and instead of test cases
you have test tasks so your input may be

632
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:02,700
you have test tasks so your input may be
 

633
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,130
you have test tasks so your input may be
instead of just your current test case

634
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:05,140
instead of just your current test case
 

635
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,440
instead of just your current test case
it would be all the information about

636
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:07,450
it would be all the information about
 

637
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,960
it would be all the information about
the new T above the test tasks plus the

638
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:09,970
the new T above the test tasks plus the
 

639
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,180
the new T above the test tasks plus the
test case and you'll try to output the

640
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:12,190
test case and you'll try to output the
 

641
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,370
test case and you'll try to output the

00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:37,980
maybe even learn a program small program

maybe even learn a program small program
or learning algorithm which you apply to

712
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:42,180

713
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,870

00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:44,880
doing meta learning so anyway but the
 

715
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,580
doing meta learning so anyway but the
point is what's happening what's really

716

point is what's happening what's really
 

717

happening in meta learning in most cases
 

719
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,920
happening in meta learning in most cases
is that you turn a training task into a

00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:54,760
physical robot as well but we can skip
 

963
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,590
physical robot as well but we can skip
it so I think the point is that the

964
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:58,600
it so I think the point is that the
 

965
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,130
it so I think the point is that the
hindsight experience replay algorithm is

966
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:01,140
hindsight experience replay algorithm is
 

967
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,010
hindsight experience replay algorithm is
directionally correct because you want

968
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:05,020
directionally correct because you want
 

969
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,890
directionally correct because you want
to make use of all your data and not

970
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:07,900
to make use of all your data and not
 

971
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,890
to make use of all your data and not
only a small fraction of it now one huge

972
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:10,900
only a small fraction of it now one huge
 

973
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,800
only a small fraction of it now one huge
question is where do you get the high

974
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:13,810
question is where do you get the high
 

975
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,530
question is where do you get the high
level states where do the high level

976
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:16,540
level states where do the high level
 

977
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,310
level states where do the high level
states come from because in the work of

978
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:20,320
states come from because in the work of
 

979
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,770
states come from because in the work of
showing you so far

980
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:21,780
showing you so far
 

981
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,090
showing you so far
the system is asked to achieve low level

982
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:24,100
the system is asked to achieve low level
 

983
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,220
the system is asked to achieve low level
States so I think one thing it will

984
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:26,230
States so I think one thing it will
 

985
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,350
States so I think one thing it will
become very important for this kind

986
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:28,360
become very important for this kind
 

987
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,660
become very important for this kind
approaches is representation learning

988
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:30,670
approaches is representation learning
 

989
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,060
approaches is representation learning
and unsupervised learning figure out

990
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,070
and unsupervised learning figure out

00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,530
and unsupervised learning figure out
what are the rights what are the right

992
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:34,540
what are the rights what are the right
 

993
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,890
what are the rights what are the right
states what's the state space of goals

00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:37,900
states what's the state space of goals
 

995

that's worth achieving now I want to go

996
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:43,930
that's worth achieving now I want to go
 

997
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,170
that's worth achieving now I want to go
through some real meta learning results

998
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:46,180
through some real meta learning results
 

999
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,500
through some real meta learning results
and I'll show you a very simple way of

1000
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:49,510
and I'll show you a very simple way of

00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:53,500
doing seem to reel from simulation to
 

1003

and encouraged a really nice intern

1008
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:00,820
and encouraged a really nice intern
 

1009
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:06,150

project in 2017 so I think we can agree

1010
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:06,160
project in 2017 so I think we can agree
 

1011
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,330
project in 2017 so I think we can agree
that in the domain of robotics it would

1012
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:09,340
that in the domain of robotics it would
 

1013
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,030
that in the domain of robotics it would
be nice if you could train your policy

1014
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:12,040
be nice if you could train your policy
 

1015
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,580
be nice if you could train your policy
in simulation and then somehow this

1016
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:14,590
in simulation and then somehow this
 

1017
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:17,960
in simulation and then somehow this
knowledge would carry over to the

1018
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:17,970
knowledge would carry over to the
 

1019
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:23,040
knowledge would carry over to the
physical robot now we can build we can

1020
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,050
physical robot now we can build we can
 

1021
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,430
physical robot now we can build we can
build simulators that are okay but they

1022
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:26,440
build simulators that are okay but they
 

1023
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,310
build simulators that are okay but they
can never perfectly match the real world

1024
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:29,320
can never perfectly match the real world
 

1025
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,200
can never perfectly match the real world
unless you want to have an insanely slow

1026
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,210
unless you want to have an insanely slow
 

1027
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,630
unless you want to have an insanely slow
simulator and the reason for that is

1028
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:33,640
simulator and the reason for that is
 

1029
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,170
simulator and the reason for that is
that it turns out that simulating freaky

1030
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:37,180
that it turns out that simulating freaky
 

1031
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:40,530
that it turns out that simulating freaky
simulating contacts is super hard and I

1032
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:40,540
simulating contacts is super hard and I
 

1033
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,360
simulating contacts is super hard and I
heard somewhere correct me if I'm wrong

1034
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:42,370
heard somewhere correct me if I'm wrong
 

1035
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,640
heard somewhere correct me if I'm wrong
that simulating friction is np-complete

1036
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:44,650
that simulating friction is np-complete
 

1037
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:48,810
that simulating friction is np-complete
I'm not sure but it's like stuff like

1038
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:48,820
I'm not sure but it's like stuff like
 

1039
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,360
I'm not sure but it's like stuff like
that so your simulation is just not

1040
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:51,370
that so your simulation is just not
 

1041
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,060
that so your simulation is just not
going to match reality there will be

1042
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:54,070
going to match reality there will be
 

1043
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,470
going to match reality there will be
some resemblance but that's it

1044
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:55,480
some resemblance but that's it
 

1045
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,850
some resemblance but that's it
how can we

1046
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:57,860
how can we
 

1047
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,799
how can we
address this problem and I want to show

1048
00:22:59,799 --> 00:22:59,809
address this problem and I want to show
 

1049
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:05,980
address this problem and I want to show
you one simple idea so let's say one

1050
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:05,990
you one simple idea so let's say one
 

1051
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,780
you one simple idea so let's say one
thing once one thing that would be nice

1052
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:07,790
thing once one thing that would be nice
 

1053
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:10,180
thing once one thing that would be nice
is that if you could learn a policy

1054
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:10,190
is that if you could learn a policy
 

1055
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,880
is that if you could learn a policy
learn a policy that would quickly adapt

1056
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:12,890
learn a policy that would quickly adapt
 

1057
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:17,770
learn a policy that would quickly adapt
itself to the real world well if you

1058
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:17,780
itself to the real world well if you
 

1059
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,210
itself to the real world well if you
want to learn a policy that can quickly

1060
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:19,220
want to learn a policy that can quickly
 

1061
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,430
want to learn a policy that can quickly
adapt we need to make sure it has

1062
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:21,440
adapt we need to make sure it has
 

1063
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,260
adapt we need to make sure it has
opportunities to adapt during training

1064
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:23,270
opportunities to adapt during training
 

1065
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:27,190
opportunities to adapt during training
time so what do we do instead of solving

1066
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:27,200
time so what do we do instead of solving
 

1067
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,970
time so what do we do instead of solving
a problem in just one simulator we add a

1068
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:30,980
a problem in just one simulator we add a
 

1069
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,680
a problem in just one simulator we add a
huge amount of variability to the

1070
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:32,690
huge amount of variability to the
 

1071
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:35,919
huge amount of variability to the
simulator we say we will randomize the

1072
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:35,929
simulator we say we will randomize the
 

1073
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:37,810
simulator we say we will randomize the
friction so we will randomize the masses

1074
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:37,820
friction so we will randomize the masses
 

1075
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,690
friction so we will randomize the masses
the length of the different objects and

1076
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:40,700
the length of the different objects and
 

1077
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,919
the length of the different objects and
their I guess M dimensions so you try to

1078
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:44,929
their I guess M dimensions so you try to
 

1079
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:48,520
their I guess M dimensions so you try to
randomize physics they simulate in lots

1080
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:48,530
randomize physics they simulate in lots
 

1081
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,380
randomize physics they simulate in lots
of different ways and then importantly

1082
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:50,390
of different ways and then importantly
 

1083
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,810
of different ways and then importantly
you don't tell the policy how you

1084
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:52,820
you don't tell the policy how you
 

1085
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,570
you don't tell the policy how you
randomized it so what is it going to do

1086
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:55,580
randomized it so what is it going to do
 

1087
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,400
randomized it so what is it going to do
then you take your policy and you put it

1088
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:57,410
then you take your policy and you put it
 

1089
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,110
then you take your policy and you put it
in an environment then says well this is

1090
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,120
in an environment then says well this is
 

1091
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,090
in an environment then says well this is
really really tough I don't know what

1092
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:01,100
really really tough I don't know what
 

1093
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,680
really really tough I don't know what
the masses are and I don't know what the

1094
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:02,690
the masses are and I don't know what the
 

1095
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,870
the masses are and I don't know what the
frictions are I need to try things out

1096
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:04,880
frictions are I need to try things out
 

1097
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,539
frictions are I need to try things out
and figure out what the friction is as I

1098
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:07,549
and figure out what the friction is as I
 

1099
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:10,419
and figure out what the friction is as I
get it responses from the environment so

1100
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:10,429
get it responses from the environment so
 

1101
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:12,669
get it responses from the environment so
you're building you you learn a certain

1102
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:12,679
you're building you you learn a certain
 

1103
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:15,100
you're building you you learn a certain
degree of adaptability into the policy

1104
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:15,110
degree of adaptability into the policy
 

1105
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,350
degree of adaptability into the policy
and it actually works

1106
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:17,360
and it actually works
 

1107
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,510
and it actually works
let's want to show you this is what

1108
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:19,520
let's want to show you this is what
 

1109
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,760
let's want to show you this is what
happens when you just strain a policy in

1110
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:21,770
happens when you just strain a policy in
 

1111
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,310
happens when you just strain a policy in
simulation and deploy it on the physical

1112
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:24,320
simulation and deploy it on the physical
 

1113
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,409
simulation and deploy it on the physical
robot and here the goal is to bring the

1114
00:24:26,409 --> 00:24:26,419
robot and here the goal is to bring the
 

1115
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:30,280
robot and here the goal is to bring the
hockey puck towards the red dot and you

1116
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:30,290
hockey puck towards the red dot and you
 

1117
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:38,049
hockey puck towards the red dot and you
will see that it will struggle and the

1118
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:38,059
will see that it will struggle and the
 

1119
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,460
will see that it will struggle and the
reason it struggles is because of the

1120
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:39,470
reason it struggles is because of the
 

1121
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,260
reason it struggles is because of the
systematic differences between the

1122
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:41,270
systematic differences between the
 

1123
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:47,500
systematic differences between the
simulator and the real physical robot so

1124
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:47,510
simulator and the real physical robot so
 

1125
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,750
simulator and the real physical robot so
I can even the basic movement is

1126
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:49,760
I can even the basic movement is
 

1127
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,490
I can even the basic movement is
difficult for the policy because the

1128
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:51,500
difficult for the policy because the
 

1129
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,039
difficult for the policy because the
assumptions are violated so much so if

1130
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:54,049
assumptions are violated so much so if
 

1131
00:24:54,049 --> 00:24:55,659
assumptions are violated so much so if
you do the training as I discussed we

1132
00:24:55,659 --> 00:24:55,669
you do the training as I discussed we
 

1133
00:24:55,669 --> 00:24:57,610
you do the training as I discussed we
train a recurrent neural network policy

1134
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:57,620
train a recurrent neural network policy
 

1135
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:00,280
train a recurrent neural network policy
which learns to quickly infer properties

1136
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:00,290
which learns to quickly infer properties
 

1137
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,490
which learns to quickly infer properties
of the simulator in order to accomplish

1138
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:03,500
of the simulator in order to accomplish
 

1139
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,409
of the simulator in order to accomplish
the task you can then give it the real

1140
00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:05,419
the task you can then give it the real
 

1141
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:06,530
the task you can then give it the real
thing

1142
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:06,540
thing
 

1143
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,150
thing
the real physics and it will do much

1144
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:08,160
the real physics and it will do much
 

1145
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,150
the real physics and it will do much
better so now this is not a perfect

1146
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:11,160
better so now this is not a perfect
 

1147
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,260
better so now this is not a perfect
technique but it's definitely very

1148
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:12,270
technique but it's definitely very
 

1149
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,450
technique but it's definitely very
promising it's promising whenever you

1150
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:14,460
promising it's promising whenever you
 

1151
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,580
promising it's promising whenever you
are able to sufficiently randomize the

1152
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:16,590
are able to sufficiently randomize the
 

1153
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:20,000
are able to sufficiently randomize the
simulator so it's definitely very nice

1154
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,010
simulator so it's definitely very nice
 

1155
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:22,370
simulator so it's definitely very nice
to see the closed-loop nature of the

1156
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:22,380
to see the closed-loop nature of the
 

1157
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,320
to see the closed-loop nature of the
policy you consider it would push the

1158
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:24,330
policy you consider it would push the
 

1159
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,330
policy you consider it would push the
hockey puck and would correct it

1160
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:26,340
hockey puck and would correct it
 

1161
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,520
hockey puck and would correct it
very very gently to bring it to the goal

1162
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:28,530
very very gently to bring it to the goal
 

1163
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:35,180
very very gently to bring it to the goal
yeah so that that was cool so that was

1164
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:35,190
yeah so that that was cool so that was
 

1165
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,610
yeah so that that was cool so that was
very that was a cool application of meta

1166
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:37,620
very that was a cool application of meta
 

1167
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,490
very that was a cool application of meta
learning I want to discuss one more

1168
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:40,500
learning I want to discuss one more
 

1169
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,520
learning I want to discuss one more
application of meta learning which is

1170
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:42,530
application of meta learning which is
 

1171
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:47,000
application of meta learning which is
learning a hierarchy of actions and this

1172
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,010
learning a hierarchy of actions and this
 

1173
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,570
learning a hierarchy of actions and this
was work done by France at all actually

1174
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:49,580
was work done by France at all actually
 

1175
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,430
was work done by France at all actually
kept in France the ancient who did it

1176
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:52,440
kept in France the ancient who did it
 

1177
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,799
kept in France the ancient who did it
was in high school I mean he wrote this

1178
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:54,809
was in high school I mean he wrote this
 

1179
00:25:54,809 --> 00:26:04,870
was in high school I mean he wrote this
paper so one thing that would be nice is

1180
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:04,880
paper so one thing that would be nice is
 

1181
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,490
paper so one thing that would be nice is
if reinforcement learning was

1182
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:07,500
if reinforcement learning was
 

1183
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,549
if reinforcement learning was
hierarchical if instead of simply taking

1184
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:10,559
hierarchical if instead of simply taking
 

1185
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,760
hierarchical if instead of simply taking
micro actions you've had some kind of

1186
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:12,770
micro actions you've had some kind of
 

1187
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:15,610
micro actions you've had some kind of
little subroutines that you could deploy

1188
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:15,620
little subroutines that you could deploy
 

1189
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,810
little subroutines that you could deploy
maybe the term subroutine is a little

1190
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:17,820
maybe the term subroutine is a little
 

1191
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,360
maybe the term subroutine is a little
bit too crude but if you had some idea

1192
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:20,370
bit too crude but if you had some idea
 

1193
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,390
bit too crude but if you had some idea
of which action primitives are worth

1194
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:23,400
of which action primitives are worth
 

1195
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,390
of which action primitives are worth
starting with now no one has been able

1196
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:26,400
starting with now no one has been able
 

1197
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,669
starting with now no one has been able
to to get actually like real value add

00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:31,679
to to get actually like real value add
 

1199
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,049
to to get actually like real value add
from curricula reinforcement learning

1200
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:33,059
from curricula reinforcement learning
 

1201
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,690
from curricula reinforcement learning
yet so far all the really cool results

1202
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:35,700
yet so far all the really cool results
 

1203
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,890
yet so far all the really cool results
all the really convincing is also

00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:36,900
all the really convincing is also
 

1205
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,039
all the really convincing is also
reinforcement learning do not use it

1206
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:39,049
reinforcement learning do not use it
 

1207
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:42,470
reinforcement learning do not use it
that's because we haven't quite figured

1208
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:42,480
that's because we haven't quite figured
 

1209
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,360
that's because we haven't quite figured
out what's the right way for

1210
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:44,370
out what's the right way for
 

1211
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,830
out what's the right way for

I just want to show you one very simple

1216
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:49,909
I just want to show you one very simple
 

1217
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:55,090
I just want to show you one very simple
approach where you use meta-learning to

1218
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:55,100
approach where you use meta-learning to
 

1219
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,610
approach where you use meta-learning to
learn to learn a hierarchy of actions so

1220
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:57,620
learn to learn a hierarchy of actions so
 

1221
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:01,659
learn to learn a hierarchy of actions so
here's what you do you have in this

1222
00:27:01,659 --> 00:27:01,669
here's what you do you have in this
 

1223
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:05,019
here's what you do you have in this
specific work you have a certain yeah

1224
00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:05,029
specific work you have a certain yeah
 

1225
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:07,230
specific work you have a certain yeah
let's say you have a certain number of

1226
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:07,240
let's say you have a certain number of
 

1227
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,250
let's say you have a certain number of
low-level primitives let's say you have

1228
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:09,260
low-level primitives let's say you have
 

1229
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,409
low-level primitives let's say you have
two ten of them and you have a

1230
00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:11,419
two ten of them and you have a
 

1231
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:15,759
two ten of them and you have a
distribution of tasks and your goal is

1232
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:15,769
distribution of tasks and your goal is
 

1233
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:20,220
distribution of tasks and your goal is
to learn low level primitives such that

1234
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:20,230
to learn low level primitives such that
 

1235
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:24,070
to learn low level primitives such that
when they are used inside a very brief

1236
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,080
when they are used inside a very brief
 

1237
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,750
when they are used inside a very brief
run of some reinforcement learning

1238
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:25,760
run of some reinforcement learning
 

1239
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,700
run of some reinforcement learning
algorithm you will make as much progress

1240
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:27,710
algorithm you will make as much progress
 

1241
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:31,419
algorithm you will make as much progress
as possible so the idea is you want to

1242
00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:31,429
as possible so the idea is you want to
 

1243
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:33,639
as possible so the idea is you want to
get the greatest amount of progress you

1244
00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:33,649
get the greatest amount of progress you
 

1245
00:27:33,649 --> 00:27:35,980
get the greatest amount of progress you
want to learn policies that result in

1246
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:35,990
want to learn policies that result in
 

1247
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,519
want to learn policies that result in
the great story you want to learn

1248
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:38,529
the great story you want to learn
 

1249
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:41,049
the great story you want to learn
primitives that result in the greatest

1250
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:41,059
primitives that result in the greatest
 

1251
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,210
primitives that result in the greatest
amount of progress is possible when used

1252
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:43,220
amount of progress is possible when used
 

1253
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,250
amount of progress is possible when used
inside learning so this is a meta

1254
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:45,260
inside learning so this is a meta
 

1255
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,600
inside learning so this is a meta
learning setter because any distribution

1256
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:46,610
learning setter because any distribution
 

1257
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:49,990
learning setter because any distribution
of tasks and here we've had if we've had

1258
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,000
of tasks and here we've had if we've had
 

1259
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,320
of tasks and here we've had if we've had
a little maze here the distribution of a

1260
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:53,330
a little maze here the distribution of a
 

1261
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,850
a little maze here the distribution of a
mazes and in this case the little bug

1262
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:54,860
mazes and in this case the little bug
 

1263
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,049
mazes and in this case the little bug
learned three policies which move it in

1264
00:27:58,049 --> 00:27:58,059
learned three policies which move it in
 

1265
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:01,090
learned three policies which move it in
its fixed direction and as a result of

1266
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:01,100
its fixed direction and as a result of
 

1267
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,500
its fixed direction and as a result of
having this hierarchy you're able to

1268
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:02,510
having this hierarchy you're able to
 

1269
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,450
having this hierarchy you're able to
solve problems really fast but only when

1270
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:04,460
solve problems really fast but only when
 

1271
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,560
solve problems really fast but only when
the hierarchy is correct

1272
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:05,570
the hierarchy is correct
 

1273
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,779
the hierarchy is correct
so horican reinforcement learning is

1274
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:07,789
so horican reinforcement learning is
 

1275
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:09,759
so horican reinforcement learning is
still working progress and this was an

1276
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:09,769
still working progress and this was an
 

1277
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:12,970
still working progress and this was an
and this work is an interesting proof

1278
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:12,980
and this work is an interesting proof
 

1279
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:19,750
and this work is an interesting proof
point of how Haruko reinforcement could

1280
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:19,760
point of how Haruko reinforcement could
 

1281
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,789
point of how Haruko reinforcement could
be like how heretical reinforcement

1282
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:21,799
be like how heretical reinforcement
 

1283
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:26,740
be like how heretical reinforcement
learning could be like if it worked now

1284
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:26,750
learning could be like if it worked now
 

1285
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,580
learning could be like if it worked now

00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:35,750
capacity method learning the specific
 

1291
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:41,330
capacity method learning the specific
limitation is that the training test

1292
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:41,340
limitation is that the training test
 

1293
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,030
limitation is that the training test
distribution has to be equal to the test

1294
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:44,040
distribution has to be equal to the test
 

1295
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,120
distribution has to be equal to the test
test distribution and I think this is a

1296
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,130
test distribution and I think this is a
 

1297
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:50,420
test distribution and I think this is a
real limitation because in reality you

00:28:59,240 --> 00:28:59,250
far so for example if you go to school
 

1307
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,930
far so for example if you go to school
you learn lots of useful things but then

1308
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:02,940
you learn lots of useful things but then
 

1309
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,960
you learn lots of useful things but then
they go to work only a fraction of this

1310
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:05,970
they go to work only a fraction of this
 

1311
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,520
they go to work only a fraction of this

determined that the strategy discovered
 

1399
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,190

one important problem that's a that
 

1431
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:05,440
one important problem that's a that
that's that we must face as we try to

1432
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:05,450
that's that we must face as we try to
 

1433
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:09,820
that's that we must face as we try to
build truly intelligent systems is what

1434
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:09,830
build truly intelligent systems is what
 

1435
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,649
build truly intelligent systems is what
is the task what are we actually

1436
00:32:11,649 --> 00:32:11,659
is the task what are we actually
 

1437
00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:15,520
is the task what are we actually
teaching the systems to do and one very

1438
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:15,530
teaching the systems to do and one very
 

1439
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,860
teaching the systems to do and one very
attractive attribute of self play is

1440
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:17,870
attractive attribute of self play is
 

1441
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:24,100
attractive attribute of self play is
that the agents create the environment

1442
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:24,110
that the agents create the environment
 

1443
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,799
that the agents create the environment
by virtue of the agent acting in the

1444
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:26,809
by virtue of the agent acting in the
 

1445
00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:30,130
by virtue of the agent acting in the
environment the environment becomes

1446
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:30,140
environment the environment becomes
 

1447
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,020
environment the environment becomes
difficult for the other agents and you

1448
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,030
difficult for the other agents and you
 

1449
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,500
difficult for the other agents and you
can see here an example of an iguana

1450
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:34,510
can see here an example of an iguana
 

1451
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,730
can see here an example of an iguana
interacting with snakes that try to eat

1452
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:36,740
interacting with snakes that try to eat
 

1453
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,350
interacting with snakes that try to eat
it

1454
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:37,360
it
 

1455
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,060
it
unsuccessfully this time so we can see

1456
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,070
unsuccessfully this time so we can see
 

1457
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,750
unsuccessfully this time so we can see
what will happen in a moment the iguana

1458
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:43,760
what will happen in a moment the iguana
 

1459
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,690
what will happen in a moment the iguana
strains best and so the fact you have

1460
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:46,700
strains best and so the fact you have
 

1461
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,419
strains best and so the fact you have
this arms race between the snakes and

1462
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:49,429
this arms race between the snakes and
 

1463
00:32:49,429 --> 00:32:50,890
this arms race between the snakes and
the iguana

1464
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:50,900
the iguana
 

1465
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,030
the iguana
motivates their development potentially

1466
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:54,040
motivates their development potentially
 

1467
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,620
motivates their development potentially
without bound and this is what happens

1468
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:56,630
without bound and this is what happens
 

1469
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,760
without bound and this is what happens
in effect in but in biological evolution

1470
00:32:59,760 --> 00:32:59,770
in effect in but in biological evolution
 

1471
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,650
in effect in but in biological evolution
now interesting work in this direction

1472
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:02,660
now interesting work in this direction
 

1473
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,040
now interesting work in this direction
was done in 1994 but Carl says there is

1474
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,050
was done in 1994 but Carl says there is
 

1475
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,250
was done in 1994 but Carl says there is
a really cool video on YouTube by Carl

1476
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:09,260
a really cool video on YouTube by Carl
 

1477
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,110
a really cool video on YouTube by Carl
seems you should check it out which

1478
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:11,120
seems you should check it out which
 

1479
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,430
seems you should check it out which
really kind of shows all the work that

1480
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:12,440
really kind of shows all the work that
 

1481
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,730
really kind of shows all the work that
he's done and here you have a little

1482
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:15,740
he's done and here you have a little
 

1483
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,230
he's done and here you have a little
competition between agents where you

1484
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:17,240
competition between agents where you
 

1485
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,090
competition between agents where you
evolved both the behavior and their

1486
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:19,100
evolved both the behavior and their
 

1487
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,780
evolved both the behavior and their
morphology when you when the agents is

1488
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:22,790
morphology when you when the agents is
 

1489
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,670
morphology when you when the agents is
trying to gain possession of a green

1490
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:24,680
trying to gain possession of a green
 

1491
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:29,050
trying to gain possession of a green
cube and so you can see that the agents

1492
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:29,060
cube and so you can see that the agents
 

1493
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,820
cube and so you can see that the agents
create the challenge for each other and

1494
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:30,830
create the challenge for each other and
 

1495
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:36,340
create the challenge for each other and
that's why they need to develop so one

1496
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:36,350
that's why they need to develop so one
 

1497
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,860
that's why they need to develop so one
thing that we did and this is work by

1498
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:38,870
thing that we did and this is work by
 

1499
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:43,450
thing that we did and this is work by
advance a little from open ai is we said

1500
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:43,460
advance a little from open ai is we said
 

1501
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,630
advance a little from open ai is we said
okay well can we demonstrate some

1502
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:46,640
okay well can we demonstrate some
 

1503
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,850
okay well can we demonstrate some
unusual results in self play that would

1504
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:48,860
unusual results in self play that would
 

1505
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,890
unusual results in self play that would
really convince us that there is

1506
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:50,900
really convince us that there is
 

1507
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,290
really convince us that there is
something there so what we did here is

1508
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:53,300
something there so what we did here is
 

1509
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,110
something there so what we did here is
that we created a small a small ring and

1510
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:56,120
that we created a small a small ring and
 

1511
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,330
that we created a small a small ring and
you have these two humanoid figures and

1512
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:58,340
you have these two humanoid figures and
 

1513
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,190
you have these two humanoid figures and
their goal is just to push each other

1514
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:00,200
their goal is just to push each other
 

1515
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,700
their goal is just to push each other
outside the ring and they don't know

1516
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:03,710
outside the ring and they don't know
 

1517
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,260
outside the ring and they don't know
anything about wrestling they don't know

1518
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:05,270
anything about wrestling they don't know
 

1519
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,300
anything about wrestling they don't know
anything about standing your balance in

1520
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:07,310
anything about standing your balance in
 

1521
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,380
anything about standing your balance in
each other they don't know anything

1522
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:08,390
each other they don't know anything
 

1523
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,510
each other they don't know anything
about centers of gravity all they know

1524
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:10,520
about centers of gravity all they know
 

1525
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,150
about centers of gravity all they know
is that if you don't do a good job then

1526
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:13,160
is that if you don't do a good job then
 

1527
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,590
is that if you don't do a good job then
your competition is going to do a better

1528
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:14,600
your competition is going to do a better
 

1529
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,710
your competition is going to do a better
job now one of the really attractive

1530
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:17,720
job now one of the really attractive
 

1531
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,120
job now one of the really attractive
things about self play is that you

1532
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:22,130
things about self play is that you
 

1533
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:25,840
things about self play is that you
always have an opponent that's roughly

1534
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:25,850
always have an opponent that's roughly
 

1535
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:29,430
always have an opponent that's roughly
as good as you are in order to learn you

1536
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:29,440
as good as you are in order to learn you
 

1537
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,020
as good as you are in order to learn you
need to sometimes win and sometimes lose

1538
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,030
need to sometimes win and sometimes lose
 

1539
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:35,110
need to sometimes win and sometimes lose
but you can't always win sometimes you

1540
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:35,120
but you can't always win sometimes you
 

1541
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,640
but you can't always win sometimes you
must fail sometimes you must succeed so

1542
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:39,650
must fail sometimes you must succeed so
 

1543
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:43,000
must fail sometimes you must succeed so
let's see what will happen here yeah so

1544
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,010
let's see what will happen here yeah so
 

1545
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,980
let's see what will happen here yeah so
it was able to do so the green humanoid

1546
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:44,990
it was able to do so the green humanoid
 

1547
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:48,880
it was able to do so the green humanoid
was able to block the ball in a Cell in

1548
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:48,890
was able to block the ball in a Cell in
 

1549
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:53,100
was able to block the ball in a Cell in
a well balanced self play environment

1550
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:53,110

 

1551
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,890

petition is always level no matter how

1552
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:55,900
petition is always level no matter how
 

1553
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,530
petition is always level no matter how
good you are or how bad you are you have

1554
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:58,540
good you are or how bad you are you have
 

1555
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,810
good you are or how bad you are you have
a competition that makes it exact

1556
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:00,820
a competition that makes it exact
 

1557
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,460
a competition that makes it exact
exactly of exactly the right challenge

1558
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:02,470
exactly of exactly the right challenge
 

1559
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,620
exactly of exactly the right challenge
for you on one thing here so this video

1560
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:04,630
for you on one thing here so this video
 

1561
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,660
for you on one thing here so this video
shows transfer learning it takes a

1562
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:06,670
shows transfer learning it takes a
 

1563
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:09,420
shows transfer learning it takes a
little wrestling humanoid and you take

1564
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:09,430
little wrestling humanoid and you take
 

1565
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,360
little wrestling humanoid and you take
its friend away and you start applying a

1566
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:12,370
its friend away and you start applying a
 

1567
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:14,550
its friend away and you start applying a
big large random forces on it and you

1568
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:14,560
big large random forces on it and you
 

1569
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,110
big large random forces on it and you
see if it can maintain its balance and

1570
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:16,120
see if it can maintain its balance and
 

1571
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,990
see if it can maintain its balance and
the answer turns out to be but yes it

1572
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:19,000
the answer turns out to be but yes it
 

1573
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,560
the answer turns out to be but yes it
can because it's been trained against an

1574
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:22,570
can because it's been trained against an
 

1575
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:25,050
can because it's been trained against an
opponent it pushes it and so that's why

1576
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:25,060
opponent it pushes it and so that's why
 

1577
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,510
opponent it pushes it and so that's why
even if it doesn't understand where the

1578
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:27,520
even if it doesn't understand where the
 

1579
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,550
even if it doesn't understand where the
fresh force is being applied on it it's

1580
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:29,560
fresh force is being applied on it it's
 

1581
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,890
fresh force is being applied on it it's
still able to balance itself so this is

1582
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:31,900
still able to balance itself so this is
 

1583
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,040
still able to balance itself so this is
one potentially attractive feature of

1584
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,050
one potentially attractive feature of
 

1585
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,450
one potentially attractive feature of
subway environments that you could learn

1586
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:36,460
subway environments that you could learn
 

1587
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:40,410
subway environments that you could learn
a certain broad set of skills although

1588
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:40,420
a certain broad set of skills although
 

1589
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,570
a certain broad set of skills although
it's real hard to control the square the

1590
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:42,580
it's real hard to control the square the
 

1591
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,550
it's real hard to control the square the
skills will be and so the biggest open

1592
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:44,560
skills will be and so the biggest open
 

1593
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,890
skills will be and so the biggest open
question with this research is how do

1594
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:46,900
question with this research is how do
 

1595
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,260
question with this research is how do
you learn agents in a software

1596
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:49,270
you learn agents in a software
 

1597
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:53,160
you learn agents in a software
environment such that they do whatever

1598
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,170
environment such that they do whatever
 

1599
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,740
environment such that they do whatever
they do but then they are able to solve

1600
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:55,750
they do but then they are able to solve
 

1601
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,020
they do but then they are able to solve
a battery of tasks that is useful for us

1602
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,030
a battery of tasks that is useful for us
 

1603
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,860
a battery of tasks that is useful for us
that is explicitly specified externally

1604
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:00,870
that is explicitly specified externally
 

1605
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:06,780
that is explicitly specified externally
yeah I also want to want to highlight

1606
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:06,790
yeah I also want to want to highlight
 

1607
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,510
yeah I also want to want to highlight
one attribute of self play environments

1608
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:09,520
one attribute of self play environments
 

1609
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,090
one attribute of self play environments
that we've observed in our dota BOTS and

1610
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:12,100
that we've observed in our dota BOTS and
 

1611
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,830
that we've observed in our dota BOTS and
that is that we've seen a very rapid

1612
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:13,840
that is that we've seen a very rapid
 

1613
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,390
that is that we've seen a very rapid
increase in the competence of the bots

1614
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:15,400
increase in the competence of the bots
 

1615
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,640
increase in the competence of the bots
so over the period over the course of

1616
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:17,650
so over the period over the course of
 

1617
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,950
so over the period over the course of
maybe five months we've seen the bots go

1618
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:19,960
maybe five months we've seen the bots go
 

1619
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,210
maybe five months we've seen the bots go
from playing totally randomly all the

1620
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:24,220
from playing totally randomly all the
 

1621
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:28,530
from playing totally randomly all the
way to the world champion and the reason

1622
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:28,540
way to the world champion and the reason
 

1623
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,780
way to the world champion and the reason
for that is that once you have a self

1624
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:30,790
for that is that once you have a self
 

1625
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:33,360
for that is that once you have a self
play environment if we put compute into

1626
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:33,370
play environment if we put compute into
 

1627
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:36,900
play environment if we put compute into
it you turn it into data self play

1628
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:36,910
it you turn it into data self play
 

1629
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:39,990
it you turn it into data self play
allows you to turn compute into data and

1630
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:40,000
allows you to turn compute into data and
 

1631
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,790
allows you to turn compute into data and
I think you will see a lot more of that

1632
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:41,800
I think you will see a lot more of that
 

1633
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,910
I think you will see a lot more of that
as being an extremely important thing to

1634
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:44,920
as being an extremely important thing to
 

1635
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,830
as being an extremely important thing to
be able to turn compute into essentially

00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:46,840
be able to turn compute into essentially
 

1637
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,040
be able to turn compute into essentially

speed of neural net processors will
 

1641
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,430
speed of neural net processors will
increase very dramatically over the next

1642
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:53,440
increase very dramatically over the next
 

1643
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,980
increase very dramatically over the next
few years so neural net cycles will be

1644
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:55,990
few years so neural net cycles will be
 

1645
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,810
few years so neural net cycles will be
cheap and it will be important to make

1646
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:57,820
cheap and it will be important to make
 

1647
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,270
cheap and it will be important to make
use of this new of newly-found

overabundance of cycles
I also want to talk a little bit about

1652
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:04,410
I also want to talk a little bit about
 

1653
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:08,749
I also want to talk a little bit about
the endgame of the self approach so one

1654
00:37:08,749 --> 00:37:08,759
the endgame of the self approach so one

thing that we know about the human brain

1656
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:11,609
thing that we know about the human brain
 

1657
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:14,509
thing that we know about the human brain
is that it has increased in sized fairly

1658
00:37:14,509 --> 00:37:14,519
is that it has increased in sized fairly
 

1659
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:17,890
is that it has increased in sized fairly
rapidly over the past two million years

1660
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:17,900
rapidly over the past two million years
 

1661
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,140
rapidly over the past two million years
my theory the reason I think it happened

1662
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:21,150
my theory the reason I think it happened
 

1663
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:25,719
my theory the reason I think it happened
is because our ancestors got to a point

1664
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:25,729
is because our ancestors got to a point
 

1665
00:37:25,729 --> 00:37:27,950
is because our ancestors got to a point
where the thing that's most important

1666
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:27,960
where the thing that's most important
 

1667
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,769
where the thing that's most important
for your survival is your standing in

1668
00:37:30,769 --> 00:37:30,779
for your survival is your standing in
 

1669
00:37:30,779 --> 00:37:33,229
for your survival is your standing in
the tribe and less the tiger and the

1670
00:37:33,229 --> 00:37:33,239
the tribe and less the tiger and the
 

1671
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:36,829
the tribe and less the tiger and the
lion once the most important thing is

1672
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:36,839
lion once the most important thing is

00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:39,079
lion once the most important thing is
how you deal with those other things

1674
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:39,089
how you deal with those other things
 

1675
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:40,940
how you deal with those other things
which have a large brain then it really

1676
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:40,950
which have a large brain then it really
 

1677
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,140
which have a large brain then it really
helps to have a slightly larger brain

1678
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:42,150
helps to have a slightly larger brain
 

1679
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,499
helps to have a slightly larger brain
and I think that's what happened and

1680
00:37:44,499 --> 00:37:44,509
and I think that's what happened and
 

1681
00:37:44,509 --> 00:37:47,120
and I think that's what happened and
there exists at least one paper from

1682
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:47,130
there exists at least one paper from
 

1683
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,650
there exists at least one paper from
science which supports this point of

1684
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:48,660
science which supports this point of
 

1685
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,259
science which supports this point of
view so apparently there has been

1686
00:37:51,259 --> 00:37:51,269
view so apparently there has been
 

1687
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,559
view so apparently there has been

between humans and birds has occurred a

00:38:07,069 --> 00:38:07,079
between humans and birds has occurred a

apes and humans apes and birds have very
 

1701
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:17,630
apes and humans apes and birds have very
different brain structure so I think

1702
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:17,640
different brain structure so I think
 

1703
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,989
different brain structure so I think
what should happen if we succeed if we

00:38:19,989 --> 00:38:19,999
what should happen if we succeed if we
 

1705
00:38:19,999 --> 00:38:22,279
what should happen if we succeed if we
successfully follow the path of this

successfully follow the path of this
 

1707
00:38:22,289 --> 00:38:23,989
successfully follow the path of this
approach is that you should create a

approach is that you should create a

00:38:23,999 --> 00:38:25,719
approach is that you should create a

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:22,810
details are right if you assume both of
 

1747
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:26,250
details are right if you assume both of
these conditions then it should follow

1748
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:26,260
these conditions then it should follow
 

1749
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,690
these conditions then it should follow
that we should see a very rapid increase

1750
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:27,700
that we should see a very rapid increase
 

1751
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,800
that we should see a very rapid increase
in the competence of our agents as they

1752
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:30,810
in the competence of our agents as they
 

1753
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:34,740
in the competence of our agents as they
live in the Society of agents so now

1754
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:34,750
live in the Society of agents so now
 

1755
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:38,810
live in the Society of agents so now
that we've talked about a potentially

1756
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:38,820
that we've talked about a potentially
 

1757
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,250
that we've talked about a potentially
interesting way of increasing the

1758
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:41,260
interesting way of increasing the
 

1759
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,079
interesting way of increasing the
competence and teachings of an agent's

1760
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:43,089
competence and teachings of an agent's
 

1761
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:46,050
competence and teachings of an agent's
social skills and language and a lot of

1762
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:46,060
social skills and language and a lot of
 

1763
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,359
social skills and language and a lot of
things that actually exist in humans as

things that actually exist in humans as
 

1765
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:50,780
things that actually exist in humans as
well we want to talk a little bit about

1766
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:50,790
well we want to talk a little bit about
 

1767
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:57,420
well we want to talk a little bit about
how you convey goals to agents and the

1768
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:57,430
how you convey goals to agents and the
 

1769
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,950
how you convey goals to agents and the
question of the main goal to eight calls

1770
00:39:58,950 --> 00:39:58,960
question of the main goal to eight calls
 

1771
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,500
question of the main goal to eight calls
to agents is just a technical problem

1772
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:00,510
to agents is just a technical problem
 

1773
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:05,430
to agents is just a technical problem
but it will be important because it is a

1774
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:05,440
but it will be important because it is a
 

1775
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,630
but it will be important because it is a
lot more likely than not that the agents

1776
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:09,640
lot more likely than not that the agents
 

1777
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,150
lot more likely than not that the agents
of evil train will eventually be

1778
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:12,160
of evil train will eventually be
 

1779
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,550
of evil train will eventually be
dramatically smarter than us and this is

1780
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:14,560
dramatically smarter than us and this is
 

1781
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,550
dramatically smarter than us and this is

1785
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,520
Paul Christiana at all and others so I'm
just going to show you this video which

1786
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:23,530
just going to show you this video which
 

1787
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,020
just going to show you this video which
basically explains how the whole thing

1788
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:25,030
basically explains how the whole thing
 

1789
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:29,099
basically explains how the whole thing
works you there is some behavior looking

1790
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:29,109
works you there is some behavior looking
 

1791
00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:33,000
works you there is some behavior looking
for and you the human gets to see pairs

1792
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,010
for and you the human gets to see pairs
 

1793
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:36,210
for and you the human gets to see pairs
of behaviors and you simply click on the

1794
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:36,220
of behaviors and you simply click on the
 

1795
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:41,819
of behaviors and you simply click on the
one that looks better and after a very

1796
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:41,829
one that looks better and after a very
 

1797
00:40:41,829 --> 00:40:45,319
one that looks better and after a very
modest number of clicks you can get this

1798
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:45,329
modest number of clicks you can get this
 

1799
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:49,859
modest number of clicks you can get this
little simulated leg to do back flips

1800
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:49,869
little simulated leg to do back flips
 

1801
00:40:49,869 --> 00:40:57,680
little simulated leg to do back flips
and there

1802
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:57,690
and there
 

1803
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:00,170
and there
go picking out the back flips and in

1804
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:00,180
go picking out the back flips and in
 

1805
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,300
go picking out the back flips and in
this to get this specific behavior it

1806
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:02,310
this to get this specific behavior it
 

1807
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:06,590
this to get this specific behavior it
took about 500 clicks by human

1808
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:06,600
took about 500 clicks by human
 

1809
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,140
took about 500 clicks by human
annotators the way it works is that you

1810
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:09,150
annotators the way it works is that you
 

1811
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,960
annotators the way it works is that you
take all the so this is a very data

1812
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:11,970
take all the so this is a very data
 

1813
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,100
take all the so this is a very data
efficient reinforcement learning

1814
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:13,110
efficient reinforcement learning
 

1815
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:15,740
efficient reinforcement learning
algorithm but it is efficient in terms

1816
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:15,750
algorithm but it is efficient in terms
 

1817
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,350
algorithm but it is efficient in terms
of rewards and not in terms of the

1818
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:18,360
of rewards and not in terms of the
 

1819
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,780
of rewards and not in terms of the
environment interactions so what you do

1820
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:20,790
environment interactions so what you do
 

1821
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:22,970
environment interactions so what you do
here is that you take all the clicks so

1822
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:22,980
here is that you take all the clicks so
 

1823
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,090
here is that you take all the clicks so
you've got your here is one B here which

1824
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:26,100
you've got your here is one B here which
 

1825
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,090
you've got your here is one B here which
is better than other you fit a reward

1826
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:29,100
is better than other you fit a reward
 

1827
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,510
is better than other you fit a reward
function a numerical reward function to

1828
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:32,520
function a numerical reward function to
 

1829
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,520
function a numerical reward function to
those clicks so you want to fit a reward

1830
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:34,530
those clicks so you want to fit a reward
 

1831
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,720
those clicks so you want to fit a reward
function which satisfies those clicks

1832
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:35,730
function which satisfies those clicks
 

1833
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,130
function which satisfies those clicks
clicks and you optimize this reward

1834
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:37,140
clicks and you optimize this reward
 

1835
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,740
clicks and you optimize this reward
function with reinforcement learning and

1836
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:38,750
function with reinforcement learning and
 

1837
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,140
function with reinforcement learning and
it actually works so this requires 500

1838
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:42,150
it actually works so this requires 500
 

1839
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:45,200
it actually works so this requires 500
bits of information you've also been

1840
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:45,210
bits of information you've also been
 

1841
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:48,200
bits of information you've also been
able to train lots of Atari games using

1842
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:48,210
able to train lots of Atari games using
 

1843
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,640
able to train lots of Atari games using
several thousand bits of information so

1844
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:49,650
several thousand bits of information so
 

1845
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:51,650
several thousand bits of information so
in all these cases you had human and

1846
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:51,660
in all these cases you had human and
 

1847
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,770
in all these cases you had human and
human annotators or human judges just

1848
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:54,780
human annotators or human judges just
 

1849
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,250
human annotators or human judges just
like in the previous slide looking at

1850
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:57,260
like in the previous slide looking at
 

1851
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:00,980
like in the previous slide looking at
the pairs of trajectories and clicking

1852
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:00,990
the pairs of trajectories and clicking
 

1853
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,000
the pairs of trajectories and clicking
on the one that they thought was better

1854
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,010
on the one that they thought was better
 

1855
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:07,880
on the one that they thought was better
and here's an example of an unusual goal

1856
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:07,890
and here's an example of an unusual goal
 

1857
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:10,700
and here's an example of an unusual goal
where this is a car racing game but the

1858
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:10,710
where this is a car racing game but the
 

1859
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:14,180
where this is a car racing game but the
goal was to ask the the agent to train

1860
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:14,190
goal was to ask the the agent to train
 

1861
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:17,570
goal was to ask the the agent to train
the white car drive right behind the

1862
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:17,580
the white car drive right behind the
 

1863
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,790
the white car drive right behind the
orange car so it's a different goal and

1864
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:19,800
orange car so it's a different goal and
 

1865
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,230
orange car so it's a different goal and
it was very straightforward to

1866
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:21,240
it was very straightforward to
 

1867
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,690
it was very straightforward to
communicate this goal using this

1868
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:23,700
communicate this goal using this
 

1869
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:30,440
communicate this goal using this
approach so then to finish off alignment

1870
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:30,450
approach so then to finish off alignment
 

1871
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:31,640
approach so then to finish off alignment
is a technical problem it has to be

1872
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:31,650
is a technical problem it has to be
 

1873
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:35,270
is a technical problem it has to be
solved but of course the determination

1874
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:35,280
solved but of course the determination
 

1875
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,650
solved but of course the determination
of the correct goals we want array

1876
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:36,660
of the correct goals we want array
 

1877
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,840
of the correct goals we want array
assistance the systems to have will be a

00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:38,850
assistance the systems to have will be a
 

1879
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:41,620
assistance the systems to have will be a
very challenging political problem and

1880
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:41,630
very challenging political problem and

00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:10,800
propagation doesn't look as though it's
 

1901
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,740
propagation doesn't look as though it's
what's going on in the brain because

1902
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:12,750
what's going on in the brain because
 

1903
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,630
what's going on in the brain because
signals in the brain go one direction

1904
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:14,640
signals in the brain go one direction
 

1905
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,520
signals in the brain go one direction
down the axons whereas back propagation

1906
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:16,530
down the axons whereas back propagation
 

1907
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:18,680
down the axons whereas back propagation
requires the errors to be propagated

1908
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:18,690
requires the errors to be propagated
 

1909
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:23,480
requires the errors to be propagated
back up the the wires so can you just

1910
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:23,490
back up the the wires so can you just
 

1911
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:24,910
back up the the wires so can you just
talk a little bit about that whole

1912
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:24,920
talk a little bit about that whole
 

1913
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,200
talk a little bit about that whole

we figure out what the brain is doing or

1922
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:35,280
we figure out what the brain is doing or
 

1923
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,250
we figure out what the brain is doing or
is the brain really sending signals back

1924
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:37,260
is the brain really sending signals back
 

1925
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,680
is the brain really sending signals back
even though it's got no obvious way of

1926
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:39,690
even though it's got no obvious way of
 

1927
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:41,090
even though it's got no obvious way of
doing that what's what's happening in

1928
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:41,100
doing that what's what's happening in
 

1929
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:44,030
doing that what's what's happening in
that area so that's a great question so

1930
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:44,040
that area so that's a great question so
 

1931
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,920
that area so that's a great question so
first of all I'll say that the true

1932
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:45,930
first of all I'll say that the true
 

1933
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:48,140
first of all I'll say that the true
answer is that the honest answer is that

1934
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:48,150
answer is that the honest answer is that
 

1935
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:52,510
answer is that the honest answer is that
I don't know but I have opinions and so

1936
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:52,520
I don't know but I have opinions and so
 

1937
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,230
I don't know but I have opinions and so
I'll say two things

1938
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:54,240
I'll say two things
 

1939
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:59,030
I'll say two things
but first of all given that look if you

1940
00:43:59,030 --> 00:43:59,040
but first of all given that look if you
 

1941
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,370
but first of all given that look if you
agree if we agree like so rather it is a

1942
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:01,380
agree if we agree like so rather it is a
 

1943
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,280
agree if we agree like so rather it is a
true fact the back propagation solves

1944
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:04,290
true fact the back propagation solves
 

1945
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:08,090
true fact the back propagation solves
the problem of circuit search this

1946
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:08,100
the problem of circuit search this
 

1947
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,980
the problem of circuit search this
problem feels like an extremely

1948
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:09,990
problem feels like an extremely
 

1949
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:12,830
problem feels like an extremely
fundamental problem and for this reason

1950
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:12,840
fundamental problem and for this reason
 

1951
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,390
fundamental problem and for this reason
I think that it's unlikely to go away

1952
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:14,400
I think that it's unlikely to go away
 

1953
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,670
I think that it's unlikely to go away
now you also write that the brain

1954
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:16,680
now you also write that the brain
 

1955
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,340
now you also write that the brain
doesn't obviously do back propagation

1956
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:19,350
doesn't obviously do back propagation
 

1957
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:20,930
doesn't obviously do back propagation

00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,670
although they've been multiple proposals
of how it could be how it could be doing

00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:27,390
them for example there's been a work by
 

1963
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:29,240
them for example there's been a work by
Tim little crap and others where they've

00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:29,250
Tim little crap and others where they've
 

1965
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,730
Tim little crap and others where they've
shown that if you use that it's possible

1966
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:31,740
shown that if you use that it's possible
 

1967
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,520
shown that if you use that it's possible
to learn a different set of connections

00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:33,530
to learn a different set of connections
 

1969
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:35,990
to learn a different set of connections
but can be used for the backward pass

00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:36,000
but can be used for the backward pass
 

1971
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,760
but can be used for the backward pass
and that can result in successful

00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:40,190
and that can result in successful
learning now the reason this hasn't been

00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:40,200
learning now the reason this hasn't been
 

1975
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,590
learning now the reason this hasn't been
like really pushed to the limit by

00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:42,600
like really pushed to the limit by
 

1977
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,390
like really pushed to the limit by
practitioners is because they say well I

1978
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:44,400
practitioners is because they say well I
 

1979
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,820
practitioners is because they say well I
got TF to the gradients I'm just not

1980
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:46,830
got TF to the gradients I'm just not
 

1981
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:48,950
got TF to the gradients I'm just not
going to worry about it but you are

1982
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:48,960
going to worry about it but you are
 

1983
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,740
going to worry about it but you are
right this is an important issue and you

1984
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:51,750
right this is an important issue and you
 

1985
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:52,700
right this is an important issue and you
know one of two things is going to

1986
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:52,710
know one of two things is going to
 

1987
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:55,070
know one of two things is going to
happen so my personal opinion is that

1988
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:55,080
happen so my personal opinion is that
 

1989
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,750
happen so my personal opinion is that
back propagation is just going to stay

1990
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:56,760
back propagation is just going to stay
 

1991
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,430
back propagation is just going to stay
with us till the very end and will

1992
00:44:58,430 --> 00:44:58,440
with us till the very end and will
 

1993
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,800
with us till the very end and will
actually build fully human level and

1994
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:00,810
actually build fully human level and
 

1995
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:02,900
actually build fully human level and
beyond systems before we understand how

1996
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:02,910
beyond systems before we understand how
 

1997
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:07,010
beyond systems before we understand how
the brain does what it does so that's

1998
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:07,020
the brain does what it does so that's
 

1999
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,890
the brain does what it does so that's
what I believe but of course it is a

2000
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:09,900
what I believe but of course it is a
 

2001
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,450
what I believe but of course it is a
difference that has to be acknowledged

2002
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:12,460
difference that has to be acknowledged
 

2003
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,940
difference that has to be acknowledged
okay thank you do you think it was a

2004
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:14,950
okay thank you do you think it was a
 

2005
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:18,750
okay thank you do you think it was a
fair matchup for the dota bot and that

2006
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:18,760
fair matchup for the dota bot and that
 

2007
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,090
fair matchup for the dota bot and that
person given the constraints of the

2008
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:21,100
person given the constraints of the
 

2009
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,640
person given the constraints of the
system so I'd say that like the biggest

2010
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:23,650
system so I'd say that like the biggest
 

2011
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:26,550
system so I'd say that like the biggest
advantage computers have in games like

2012
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:26,560
advantage computers have in games like
 

2013
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,440
advantage computers have in games like
this like one of the big advantages is

2014
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:28,450
this like one of the big advantages is
 

2015
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:30,930
this like one of the big advantages is
that they obviously have a better

2016
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:30,940
that they obviously have a better
 

2017
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:33,060
that they obviously have a better
reaction time although in DotA in

2018
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:33,070
reaction time although in DotA in
 

2019
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:35,430
reaction time although in DotA in
particular the number of clicks per

2020
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:35,440
particular the number of clicks per
 

2021
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,280
particular the number of clicks per
second over the top players is fairly

2022
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:38,290
second over the top players is fairly
 

2023
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:40,020
second over the top players is fairly
small which is different from Starcraft

2024
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:40,030
small which is different from Starcraft
 

2025
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:42,540
small which is different from Starcraft
so in Starcraft stuff up is a very

2026
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:42,550
so in Starcraft stuff up is a very
 

2027
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:45,000
so in Starcraft stuff up is a very
compact mechanically heavy game because

2028
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,010
compact mechanically heavy game because
 

2029
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:47,130
compact mechanically heavy game because
of a large number of units and so the

2030
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:47,140
of a large number of units and so the
 

2031
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,640
of a large number of units and so the
top players that is click all the time

2032
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:49,650
top players that is click all the time
 

2033
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:52,590
top players that is click all the time
in DotA every player controls just one

2034
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:52,600
in DotA every player controls just one
 

2035
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,990
in DotA every player controls just one
hero and so that greatly reduces the

2036
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:55,000
hero and so that greatly reduces the
 

2037
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,370
hero and so that greatly reduces the
total number of actions they need to

2038
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:56,380
total number of actions they need to
 

2039
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,620
total number of actions they need to
make now still precision matters I think

2040
00:45:58,620 --> 00:45:58,630
make now still precision matters I think
 

2041
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:02,640
make now still precision matters I think
that will discover that but what I think

2042
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:02,650
that will discover that but what I think
 

2043
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:03,780
that will discover that but what I think
it'll really happen is if you'll

2044
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:03,790
it'll really happen is if you'll
 

2045
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:05,640
it'll really happen is if you'll
discover that computers have the

2046
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:05,650
discover that computers have the
 

2047
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:11,520
discover that computers have the
advantage in any domain or rather every

2048
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:11,530
advantage in any domain or rather every
 

2049
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:16,230
advantage in any domain or rather every
domain not yet so do you think that the

2050
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:16,240
domain not yet so do you think that the
 

2051
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,210
domain not yet so do you think that the
emergent behaviors from the agent were

2052
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:18,220
emergent behaviors from the agent were
 

2053
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:21,150
emergent behaviors from the agent were
actually kind of directed because the

2054
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:21,160
actually kind of directed because the
 

2055
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,770
actually kind of directed because the
constraints already kinda in place like

2056
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:22,780
constraints already kinda in place like
 

2057
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,970
constraints already kinda in place like
so it was kind of forced discover those

2058
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:23,980
so it was kind of forced discover those
 

2059
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:26,820
so it was kind of forced discover those
or do you think that like that was

2060
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:26,830
or do you think that like that was
 

2061
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:28,200
or do you think that like that was
actually something quite novel that like

2062
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:28,210
actually something quite novel that like
 

2063
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:30,510
actually something quite novel that like
wow it actually discovered these on its

2064
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:30,520
wow it actually discovered these on its
 

2065
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,280
wow it actually discovered these on its
own like you didn't actually am biased

2066
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:32,290
own like you didn't actually am biased
 

2067
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,810
own like you didn't actually am biased
towards constraining it so it's

2068
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:33,820
towards constraining it so it's
 

2069
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:35,910
towards constraining it so it's
definitely discover new strategies and I

2070
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:35,920
definitely discover new strategies and I
 

2071
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,610
definitely discover new strategies and I
can share an anecdote where our tester

2072
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:38,620
can share an anecdote where our tester
 

2073
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,680
can share an anecdote where our tester
we have a probe which would test the

2074
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:40,690
we have a probe which would test the
 

2075
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:44,190
we have a probe which would test the
bots and he played against for a long

2076
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:44,200
bots and he played against for a long
 

2077
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,080
bots and he played against for a long
time and the bots would do all kinds of

2078
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:46,090
time and the bots would do all kinds of
 

2079
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:48,390
time and the bots would do all kinds of
things against the player the human

2080
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:48,400
things against the player the human
 

2081
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,400
things against the player the human
player which were effective then at some

2082
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:50,410
player which were effective then at some
 

2083
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:53,370
player which were effective then at some
point that Pro decided to play against

2084
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:53,380
point that Pro decided to play against
 

2085
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,590
point that Pro decided to play against
the better plot Pro and he decided to

2086
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:55,600
the better plot Pro and he decided to
 

2087
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,910
the better plot Pro and he decided to
imitate one of the things that the bot

2088
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:56,920
imitate one of the things that the bot
 

2089
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,270
imitate one of the things that the bot
was doing and this image but by

2090
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:00,280
was doing and this image but by
 

2091
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,040
was doing and this image but by
imitating if he was able to defeat a

2092
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:02,050
imitating if he was able to defeat a
 

2093
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:04,290
imitating if he was able to defeat a
better pro so I think I think the

2094
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:04,300
better pro so I think I think the
 

2095
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,630
better pro so I think I think the
strategy discovers are real and so like

2096
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:06,640
strategy discovers are real and so like
 

2097
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,790
strategy discovers are real and so like
it means that like this very real

2098
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:08,800
it means that like this very real
 

2099
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,760
it means that like this very real
transformative Tran you know I would say

2100
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:11,770
transformative Tran you know I would say
 

2101
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:15,690
transformative Tran you know I would say
I think what that means is that he

2102
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:15,700
I think what that means is that he
 

2103
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,310
I think what that means is that he
because the strategies discovered by the

2104
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:17,320
because the strategies discovered by the
 

2105
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,350
because the strategies discovered by the
bot of the humans it means that we like

2106
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:19,360
bot of the humans it means that we like
 

2107
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:22,250
bot of the humans it means that we like
a fundamental game plays deeply related

2108
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:22,260
a fundamental game plays deeply related
 

2109
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:25,309
a fundamental game plays deeply related
for a long time now I've heard that the

2110
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:25,319
for a long time now I've heard that the
 

2111
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:27,439
for a long time now I've heard that the
objective of reinforcement learning is

2112
00:47:27,439 --> 00:47:27,449
objective of reinforcement learning is
 

2113
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:30,709
objective of reinforcement learning is
to determine a policy that chooses an

2114
00:47:30,709 --> 00:47:30,719
to determine a policy that chooses an
 

2115
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:33,709
to determine a policy that chooses an
action to maximize the expected reward

2116
00:47:33,709 --> 00:47:33,719
action to maximize the expected reward
 

2117
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:36,410
action to maximize the expected reward
which is what you said earlier would you

2118
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:36,420
which is what you said earlier would you
 

2119
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,390
which is what you said earlier would you
ever want to look at the standard

2120
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:38,400
ever want to look at the standard
 

2121
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,809
ever want to look at the standard
deviation of possible rewards does that

2122
00:47:41,809 --> 00:47:41,819
deviation of possible rewards does that
 

2123
00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:44,479
deviation of possible rewards does that
even make sense yeah I mean I think for

2124
00:47:44,479 --> 00:47:44,489
even make sense yeah I mean I think for
 

2125
00:47:44,489 --> 00:47:45,769
even make sense yeah I mean I think for
sure I think it's a really application

2126
00:47:45,769 --> 00:47:45,779
sure I think it's a really application
 

2127
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:49,519
sure I think it's a really application
dependent one of the reasons to maximize

2128
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:49,529
dependent one of the reasons to maximize
 

2129
00:47:49,529 --> 00:47:52,099
dependent one of the reasons to maximize
the expected reward it's because it's

2130
00:47:52,099 --> 00:47:52,109
the expected reward it's because it's
 

2131
00:47:52,109 --> 00:47:53,859
the expected reward it's because it's
easier to design algorithms for it

2132
00:47:53,859 --> 00:47:53,869
easier to design algorithms for it
 

2133
00:47:53,869 --> 00:47:58,519
easier to design algorithms for it
so you write down this equation the

2134
00:47:58,519 --> 00:47:58,529
so you write down this equation the
 

2135
00:47:58,529 --> 00:47:59,719
so you write down this equation the
formula you do a little bit of

2136
00:47:59,719 --> 00:47:59,729
formula you do a little bit of
 

2137
00:47:59,729 --> 00:48:02,029
formula you do a little bit of
derivation you get something which

2138
00:48:02,029 --> 00:48:02,039
derivation you get something which
 

2139
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:03,949
derivation you get something which
amounts to a nice-looking algorithm now

2140
00:48:03,949 --> 00:48:03,959
amounts to a nice-looking algorithm now
 

2141
00:48:03,959 --> 00:48:08,809
amounts to a nice-looking algorithm now
I think there exist like really there

2142
00:48:08,809 --> 00:48:08,819
I think there exist like really there
 

2143
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:10,130
I think there exist like really there
exist applications where you'd never

2144
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:10,140
exist applications where you'd never
 

2145
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,449
exist applications where you'd never
want to make mistakes and you want to

2146
00:48:11,449 --> 00:48:11,459
want to make mistakes and you want to
 

2147
00:48:11,459 --> 00:48:12,999
want to make mistakes and you want to
work on the standard deviation as well

2148
00:48:12,999 --> 00:48:13,009
work on the standard deviation as well
 

2149
00:48:13,009 --> 00:48:16,579
work on the standard deviation as well
but in practice it seems that the just

2150
00:48:16,579 --> 00:48:16,589
but in practice it seems that the just
 

2151
00:48:16,589 --> 00:48:18,249
but in practice it seems that the just
looking at the expected reward covers a

2152
00:48:18,249 --> 00:48:18,259
looking at the expected reward covers a
 

2153
00:48:18,259 --> 00:48:23,180
looking at the expected reward covers a
large fraction of the B the situation as

2154
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:23,190
large fraction of the B the situation as
 

2155
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:28,569
large fraction of the B the situation as
you'd like to apply this door Thanks

2156
00:48:28,569 --> 00:48:28,579

 

2157
00:48:28,579 --> 00:48:32,680

we talked last week about motivations

2158
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:32,690
we talked last week about motivations
 

2159
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:35,499
we talked last week about motivations
and that has a lot to do with the

2160
00:48:35,499 --> 00:48:35,509
and that has a lot to do with the
 

2161
00:48:35,509 --> 00:48:39,410
and that has a lot to do with the
reinforcement and some of the ideas is

2162
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:39,420
reinforcement and some of the ideas is
 

2163
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:42,469
reinforcement and some of the ideas is
that the our motivations are actually

2164
00:48:42,469 --> 00:48:42,479
that the our motivations are actually
 

2165
00:48:42,479 --> 00:48:45,799
that the our motivations are actually
connection with others and cooperation

2166
00:48:45,799 --> 00:48:45,809
connection with others and cooperation
 

2167
00:48:45,809 --> 00:48:48,109
connection with others and cooperation
and I'm wondering if they're thrown off

2168
00:48:48,109 --> 00:48:48,119
and I'm wondering if they're thrown off
 

2169
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:50,420
and I'm wondering if they're thrown off
and I understand it's very popular to

2170
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:50,430
and I understand it's very popular to
 

2171
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:52,489
and I understand it's very popular to
have the computers play these

2172
00:48:52,489 --> 00:48:52,499
have the computers play these
 

2173
00:48:52,499 --> 00:48:56,059
have the computers play these
competitive games but is there any use

2174
00:48:56,059 --> 00:48:56,069
competitive games but is there any use
 

2175
00:48:56,069 --> 00:49:00,309
competitive games but is there any use
in like having an agent self play

2176
00:49:00,309 --> 00:49:00,319
in like having an agent self play
 

2177
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:03,859
in like having an agent self play
collaboratively collaborative games Yeah

2178
00:49:03,859 --> 00:49:03,869
collaboratively collaborative games Yeah
 

2179
00:49:03,869 --> 00:49:05,539
collaboratively collaborative games Yeah
right that's an extremely good question

2180
00:49:05,539 --> 00:49:05,549
right that's an extremely good question
 

2181
00:49:05,549 --> 00:49:09,049
right that's an extremely good question
I don't think one place from which we

2182
00:49:09,049 --> 00:49:09,059
I don't think one place from which we
 

2183
00:49:09,059 --> 00:49:11,239
I don't think one place from which we
can get some inspiration is from the

2184
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:11,249
can get some inspiration is from the
 

2185
00:49:11,249 --> 00:49:12,549
can get some inspiration is from the
evolution of cooperation

2186
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:12,559
evolution of cooperation
 

2187
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:17,930
evolution of cooperation
like I think cooperation like we

2188
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:17,940
like I think cooperation like we
 

2189
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:21,049
like I think cooperation like we
cooperate ultimately because it's much

2190
00:49:21,049 --> 00:49:21,059
cooperate ultimately because it's much
 

2191
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:22,699
cooperate ultimately because it's much
better for you the person to be

2192
00:49:22,699 --> 00:49:22,709
better for you the person to be
 

2193
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:27,410
better for you the person to be
cooperative than not and so I think what

2194
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:27,420
cooperative than not and so I think what
 

2195
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:28,640
cooperative than not and so I think what
should happen

2196
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:28,650
should happen
 

2197
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:31,100
should happen
if you have a sufficiently open-ended

2198
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:31,110
if you have a sufficiently open-ended
 

2199
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:34,670
if you have a sufficiently open-ended
game then cooperation will be the

2200
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:34,680
game then cooperation will be the
 

2201
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,280
game then cooperation will be the
winning strategy and so I think we will

2202
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:37,290
winning strategy and so I think we will
 

2203
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:39,020
winning strategy and so I think we will
get cooperation whether we like it or

2204
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:39,030
get cooperation whether we like it or
 

2205
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:44,930
get cooperation whether we like it or
not Hey

2206
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:44,940
not Hey
 

2207
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,480
not Hey
you mentioned the complexity of this

2208
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:47,490
you mentioned the complexity of this
 

2209
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:50,780
you mentioned the complexity of this
simulation of friction I was wondering

2210
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:50,790
simulation of friction I was wondering
 

2211
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:52,940
simulation of friction I was wondering
if you feel that there exists open

2212

00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,030
in a complexity theoretic sense now it
is also the case that many of the

but to think it will change very soon

00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:17,659
but to think it will change very soon
now I also agree with you that there are

patently wrong is the fact that we train

patently wrong is the fact that we train
 

2343
00:52:37,829 --> 00:52:40,159
patently wrong is the fact that we train

a model then you stop training the model
 

2345
00:52:40,169 --> 00:52:43,819
a model then you stop training the model

training process where the magic really
 

2349
00:52:45,509 --> 00:52:48,889
training process where the magic really
happens but the magic is that if you

2350
00:52:48,889 --> 00:52:48,899
happens but the magic is that if you
 

2351
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:51,829
happens but the magic is that if you
think about it like the training process

2352
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:51,839
think about it like the training process
 

2353
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,349
think about it like the training process
is the true general part of the whole of

whatever just give me the data set I

don't care which one solve I'll sew them

so like the ability to do that feels

00:53:06,799 --> 00:53:06,809
so like the ability to do that feels
 

2369
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:08,689
so like the ability to do that feels
really special and I think we are not

00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:08,699
really special and I think we are not
 

2371
00:53:08,699 --> 00:53:12,109
really special and I think we are not
using it at test time like it's hard to

2372
00:53:12,109 --> 00:53:12,119
using it at test time like it's hard to
 

2373
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:14,299
using it at test time like it's hard to
speculate about like things which you

2374
00:53:14,299 --> 00:53:14,309
speculate about like things which you
 

2375
00:53:14,309 --> 00:53:15,620
speculate about like things which you
don't know the answer but all I'll say

2376
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:15,630
don't know the answer but all I'll say
 

2377
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:18,409
don't know the answer but all I'll say
is that simply train bigger deeper

2378
00:53:18,409 --> 00:53:18,419
is that simply train bigger deeper
 

2379
00:53:18,419 --> 00:53:20,959
is that simply train bigger deeper
language models you'll go surprisingly

2380
00:53:20,959 --> 00:53:20,969
language models you'll go surprisingly
 

2381
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:23,599
language models you'll go surprisingly
far scaling up but also doing things

2382
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:23,609
far scaling up but also doing things
 

2383
00:53:23,609 --> 00:53:24,919
far scaling up but also doing things
like training a test them and inference

2384
00:53:24,919 --> 00:53:24,929
like training a test them and inference
 

2385
00:53:24,929 --> 00:53:25,999
like training a test them and inference
the test time I think would be another

2386
00:53:25,999 --> 00:53:26,009
the test time I think would be another
 

2387
00:53:26,009 --> 00:53:30,409
the test time I think would be another
important boosts the performance hi

2388
00:53:30,409 --> 00:53:30,419
important boosts the performance hi
 

2389
00:53:30,419 --> 00:53:33,559
important boosts the performance hi
thank you for the talk so it seems like

2390
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:33,569
thank you for the talk so it seems like
 

2391
00:53:33,569 --> 00:53:34,969
thank you for the talk so it seems like
right now another interesting approach

2392
00:53:34,969 --> 00:53:34,979
right now another interesting approach
 

2393
00:53:34,979 --> 00:53:36,169
right now another interesting approach
to solving reinforcement learning

2394
00:53:36,169 --> 00:53:36,179
to solving reinforcement learning
 

2395
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:37,909
to solving reinforcement learning
problems could be to go for the

2396
00:53:37,909 --> 00:53:37,919
problems could be to go for the
 

2397
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:40,099
problems could be to go for the
evolutionary roots using evolutionary

2398
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:40,109
evolutionary roots using evolutionary
 

2399
00:53:40,109 --> 00:53:42,229
evolutionary roots using evolutionary
strategies and although they have they

2400
00:53:42,229 --> 00:53:42,239
strategies and although they have they
 

2401
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:44,779
strategies and although they have they
their cave Hut's I wanted to know if I'd

2402
00:53:44,779 --> 00:53:44,789
their cave Hut's I wanted to know if I'd
 

2403
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:46,669
their cave Hut's I wanted to know if I'd
open a I particularly you're working on

2404
00:53:46,669 --> 00:53:46,679
open a I particularly you're working on
 

2405
00:53:46,679 --> 00:53:48,620
open a I particularly you're working on
something related and what are what is

2406
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:48,630
something related and what are what is
 

2407
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:50,269
something related and what are what is
your general opinion on them

2408
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:50,279
your general opinion on them
 

2409
00:53:50,279 --> 00:53:54,000
your general opinion on them
so like at present I believe that

2410
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:54,010
so like at present I believe that
 

2411
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:55,620
so like at present I believe that
something evolutionary strategies is not

2412
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:55,630
something evolutionary strategies is not
 

2413
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:58,859
something evolutionary strategies is not
great for reinforcement learning I think

2414
00:53:58,859 --> 00:53:58,869
great for reinforcement learning I think
 

2415
00:53:58,869 --> 00:53:59,970
great for reinforcement learning I think
that normal reinforcement learning

2416
00:53:59,970 --> 00:53:59,980
that normal reinforcement learning
 

2417
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:02,039
that normal reinforcement learning
algorithms especially with big policies

2418
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:02,049
algorithms especially with big policies
 

2419
00:54:02,049 --> 00:54:04,650
algorithms especially with big policies
are better but I think if you want to

2420
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:04,660
are better but I think if you want to
 

2421
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:08,309
are better but I think if you want to
evolve a small compact object like like

2422
00:54:08,309 --> 00:54:08,319
evolve a small compact object like like
 

2423
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:10,650
evolve a small compact object like like
a piece of code for example I think that

2424
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:10,660
a piece of code for example I think that
 

2425
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:12,779
a piece of code for example I think that
would be a place where this would be

2426
00:54:12,779 --> 00:54:12,789
would be a place where this would be
 

2427
00:54:12,789 --> 00:54:15,299
would be a place where this would be
seriously was considering but this all

2428
00:54:15,299 --> 00:54:15,309
seriously was considering but this all
 

2429
00:54:15,309 --> 00:54:19,319
seriously was considering but this all
you know evolving a beautiful piece of

2430
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:19,329
you know evolving a beautiful piece of
 

2431
00:54:19,329 --> 00:54:21,329
you know evolving a beautiful piece of
code is a cool idea hasn't been done yet

2432
00:54:21,329 --> 00:54:21,339
code is a cool idea hasn't been done yet
 

2433
00:54:21,339 --> 00:54:23,490
code is a cool idea hasn't been done yet
so still a lot of work to be done before

2434
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:23,500
so still a lot of work to be done before
 

2435
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,039
so still a lot of work to be done before
we get there hi thank you so much for

2436
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:26,049
we get there hi thank you so much for
 

2437
00:54:26,049 --> 00:54:29,279
we get there hi thank you so much for
coming my question is you mentioned what

2438
00:54:29,279 --> 00:54:29,289
coming my question is you mentioned what
 

2439
00:54:29,289 --> 00:54:31,829
coming my question is you mentioned what
is the right go is a political problem

2440
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:31,839
is the right go is a political problem
 

2441
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,569
is the right go is a political problem
so I'm wondering if you can elaborate a

2442
00:54:33,569 --> 00:54:33,579
so I'm wondering if you can elaborate a
 

2443
00:54:33,579 --> 00:54:35,940
so I'm wondering if you can elaborate a
bit on that and also what do you think

2444
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:35,950
bit on that and also what do you think
 

2445
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:37,890
bit on that and also what do you think
would be their approach for us to maybe

2446
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:37,900
would be their approach for us to maybe
 

2447
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:41,309
would be their approach for us to maybe
get there well I can't I can't really

2448
00:54:41,309 --> 00:54:41,319
get there well I can't I can't really
 

2449
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:42,779
get there well I can't I can't really
comment too much because all the

2450
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:42,789
comment too much because all the
 

2451
00:54:42,789 --> 00:54:46,230
comment too much because all the
thoughts that you know we have we now

2452
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:46,240
thoughts that you know we have we now
 

2453
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,029
thoughts that you know we have we now
have a few people who are thinking about

2454
00:54:48,029 --> 00:54:48,039
have a few people who are thinking about
 

2455
00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:52,200
have a few people who are thinking about
this full-time at opening I I don't have

2456
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:52,210
this full-time at opening I I don't have
 

2457
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:55,740
this full-time at opening I I don't have
enough of a super strong opinion to say

2458
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:55,750
enough of a super strong opinion to say
 

2459
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,680
enough of a super strong opinion to say
anything too definitive all I can say at

2460
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:58,690
anything too definitive all I can say at
 

2461
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:00,960
anything too definitive all I can say at
the very high level is given the size

2462
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:00,970
the very high level is given the size
 

2463
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:02,700
the very high level is given the size
like if you go into the future whenever

2464
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:02,710
like if you go into the future whenever
 

2465
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:05,160
like if you go into the future whenever
soon or late you know whenever it's

2466
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:05,170
soon or late you know whenever it's
 

2467
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:06,089
soon or late you know whenever it's
going to happen when you build a

2468
00:55:06,089 --> 00:55:06,099
going to happen when you build a
 

2469
00:55:06,099 --> 00:55:09,059
going to happen when you build a
computer which can do anything better

2470
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:09,069
computer which can do anything better
 

2471
00:55:09,069 --> 00:55:11,490
computer which can do anything better
than a human it will happen because the

2472
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:11,500
than a human it will happen because the
 

2473
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:14,579
than a human it will happen because the
brain is physical the impact on society

2474
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:14,589
brain is physical the impact on society
 

2475
00:55:14,589 --> 00:55:16,620
brain is physical the impact on society
is going to be completely massive and

2476
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:16,630
is going to be completely massive and
 

2477
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:20,039
is going to be completely massive and
overwhelming it's it's very difficult to

2478
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:20,049
overwhelming it's it's very difficult to
 

2479
00:55:20,049 --> 00:55:23,309
overwhelming it's it's very difficult to
imagine even if you try really hard and

2480
00:55:23,309 --> 00:55:23,319
imagine even if you try really hard and
 

2481
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:25,289
imagine even if you try really hard and
I think what it means is that people who

2482
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:25,299
I think what it means is that people who
 

2483
00:55:25,299 --> 00:55:28,769
I think what it means is that people who
care a lot and that's what I was

2484
00:55:28,769 --> 00:55:28,779
care a lot and that's what I was
 

2485
00:55:28,779 --> 00:55:30,299
care a lot and that's what I was
alluding to the fact that this will be

2486
00:55:30,299 --> 00:55:30,309
alluding to the fact that this will be
 

2487
00:55:30,309 --> 00:55:32,249
alluding to the fact that this will be
something that many people who care

2488
00:55:32,249 --> 00:55:32,259
something that many people who care
 

2489
00:55:32,259 --> 00:55:36,509
something that many people who care
about strongly and like as the impact

2490
00:55:36,509 --> 00:55:36,519
about strongly and like as the impact
 

2491
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:38,249
about strongly and like as the impact
increases gradually with self-driving

2492
00:55:38,249 --> 00:55:38,259
increases gradually with self-driving
 

2493
00:55:38,259 --> 00:55:40,170
increases gradually with self-driving
cars more automation I think we will see

2494
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:40,180
cars more automation I think we will see
 

2495
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:43,200
cars more automation I think we will see
a lot more people care do we need to

2496
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:43,210
a lot more people care do we need to
 

2497
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:45,660
a lot more people care do we need to
have a very accurate model of the

2498
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:45,670
have a very accurate model of the
 

2499
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:48,690
have a very accurate model of the
physical world and then simulate that in

2500
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:48,700
physical world and then simulate that in
 

2501
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:51,870
physical world and then simulate that in
order to have these agents that can

2502
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:51,880
order to have these agents that can
 

2503
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,249
order to have these agents that can
eventually come out into the real world

2504
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:53,259
eventually come out into the real world
 

2505
00:55:53,259 --> 00:55:56,490
eventually come out into the real world
and do something approaching you know

2506
00:55:56,490 --> 00:55:56,500
and do something approaching you know
 

2507
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:59,849
and do something approaching you know
human level intelligence tasks that's a

2508
00:55:59,849 --> 00:55:59,859
human level intelligence tasks that's a
 

2509
00:55:59,859 --> 00:56:02,190
human level intelligence tasks that's a
very good question so I think if that

2510
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:02,200
very good question so I think if that
 

2511
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,370
very good question so I think if that
were the case

2512
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:03,380
were the case
 

2513
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:09,249
were the case
be in trouble and I am very certain that

2514
00:56:09,249 --> 00:56:09,259
be in trouble and I am very certain that
 

2515
00:56:09,259 --> 00:56:11,920
be in trouble and I am very certain that
it could be avoided so specifically the

2516
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:11,930
it could be avoided so specifically the
 

2517
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:14,920
it could be avoided so specifically the
real answer has to be that look you

2518
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:14,930
real answer has to be that look you
 

2519
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:17,140
real answer has to be that look you
learn the problem so we learn to

2520
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:17,150
learn the problem so we learn to
 

2521
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:18,970
learn the problem so we learn to
negotiate you learn to persist you not a

2522
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:18,980
negotiate you learn to persist you not a
 

2523
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,980
negotiate you learn to persist you not a
lots of different useful life lessons in

2524
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:20,990
lots of different useful life lessons in
 

2525
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:22,569
lots of different useful life lessons in
the simulation and yes you learn some

2526
00:56:22,569 --> 00:56:22,579
the simulation and yes you learn some
 

2527
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:24,190
the simulation and yes you learn some
physics too but then you go outside to

2528
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:24,200
physics too but then you go outside to
 

2529
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:24,880
physics too but then you go outside to
the real world

2530
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:24,890
the real world
 

2531
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:26,650
the real world
and you have to start over to some

2532
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:26,660
and you have to start over to some
 

2533
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,839
and you have to start over to some
extent because many of you are deeply

2534
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:28,849
extent because many of you are deeply
 

2535
00:56:28,849 --> 00:56:31,450
extent because many of you are deeply
held assumptions will be false in one of

2536
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:31,460
held assumptions will be false in one of
 

2537
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,819
held assumptions will be false in one of
the goals so what was that's one reasons

2538
00:56:33,819 --> 00:56:33,829
the goals so what was that's one reasons
 

2539
00:56:33,829 --> 00:56:36,579
the goals so what was that's one reasons
I care so much about never stopping

you for whatever it is you need to know
it work

2576
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:10,250
it work
 

2577
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:12,279
it work
it will help somewhat you'll be able to

2578
00:57:12,279 --> 00:57:12,289
it will help somewhat you'll be able to
 

2579
00:57:12,289 --> 00:57:13,390
it will help somewhat you'll be able to
get off the ground but it will be lots

2580
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:13,400
get off the ground but it will be lots
 

2581
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,799
get off the ground but it will be lots
of new things you need to learn so

2582
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:14,809
of new things you need to learn so
 

2583
00:57:14,809 --> 00:57:16,870
of new things you need to learn so
that's that's the spirit of it I think

2584
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:16,880
that's that's the spirit of it I think
 

2585
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,240
that's that's the spirit of it I think
of a toes of the school one of the

2586
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:19,250
of a toes of the school one of the
 

2587
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:20,980
of a toes of the school one of the
things you mentioned pretty early on in

2588
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:20,990
things you mentioned pretty early on in
 

2589
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:22,569
things you mentioned pretty early on in
your talk is that one of the limitations

2590
00:57:22,569 --> 00:57:22,579
your talk is that one of the limitations
 

2591
00:57:22,579 --> 00:57:24,579
your talk is that one of the limitations
of this sort of style of reinforcement

2592
00:57:24,579 --> 00:57:24,589
of this sort of style of reinforcement
 

2593
00:57:24,589 --> 00:57:26,650
of this sort of style of reinforcement
learning is there's no self-organization

2594
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:26,660
learning is there's no self-organization
 

2595
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:28,420
learning is there's no self-organization
so you have to tell it when it did a

2596
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:28,430
so you have to tell it when it did a
 

2597
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:30,099
so you have to tell it when it did a
good thing or did a bad thing and that's

2598
00:57:30,099 --> 00:57:30,109
good thing or did a bad thing and that's
 

2599
00:57:30,109 --> 00:57:31,599
good thing or did a bad thing and that's
actually a problem in neuroscience is

2600
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:31,609
actually a problem in neuroscience is
 

2601
00:57:31,609 --> 00:57:32,950
actually a problem in neuroscience is
when you're trying to teach a rat to you

2602
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:32,960
when you're trying to teach a rat to you
 

2603
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,180
when you're trying to teach a rat to you
know navigate maze you have to

2604
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:34,190
know navigate maze you have to
 

2605
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:36,819
know navigate maze you have to
artificially tell it what to do so where

2606
00:57:36,819 --> 00:57:36,829
artificially tell it what to do so where
 

2607
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:38,049
artificially tell it what to do so where
do you see moving forward when we

2608
00:57:38,049 --> 00:57:38,059
do you see moving forward when we
 

2609
00:57:38,059 --> 00:57:39,279
do you see moving forward when we
already have this problem with teaching

2610
00:57:39,279 --> 00:57:39,289
already have this problem with teaching
 

2611
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,230
already have this problem with teaching
you know not necessarily learning but

2612
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:41,240
you know not necessarily learning but
 

2613
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,670
you know not necessarily learning but
also teaching so where do you see the

2614
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:42,680
also teaching so where do you see the
 

2615
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,349
also teaching so where do you see the
research moving forward in that respect

2616
00:57:44,349 --> 00:57:44,359
research moving forward in that respect
 

2617
00:57:44,359 --> 00:57:46,240
research moving forward in that respect
how do you sort of introduce this notion

2618
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:46,250
how do you sort of introduce this notion
 

2619
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:48,609
how do you sort of introduce this notion
of self-organization so I think without

2620
00:57:48,609 --> 00:57:48,619
of self-organization so I think without
 

2621
00:57:48,619 --> 00:57:50,289
of self-organization so I think without
question one really important thing you

2622
00:57:50,289 --> 00:57:50,299
question one really important thing you
 

2623
00:57:50,299 --> 00:57:54,249
question one really important thing you
need to do is to be able to infer the

2624
00:57:54,249 --> 00:57:54,259
need to do is to be able to infer the
 

2625
00:57:54,259 --> 00:57:56,559
need to do is to be able to infer the
goals and strategies of other agents by

2626
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:56,569
goals and strategies of other agents by
 

2627
00:57:56,569 --> 00:57:59,170
goals and strategies of other agents by
observing them that's a fundamental

2628
00:57:59,170 --> 00:57:59,180
observing them that's a fundamental
 

2629
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:01,539
observing them that's a fundamental
skill we need to be able to learn to to

2630
00:58:01,539 --> 00:58:01,549
skill we need to be able to learn to to
 

2631
00:58:01,549 --> 00:58:03,279
skill we need to be able to learn to to
embed into the agent so if for example

2632
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:03,289
embed into the agent so if for example
 

2633
00:58:03,289 --> 00:58:05,319
embed into the agent so if for example
you have two agents one of them is doing

2634
00:58:05,319 --> 00:58:05,329
you have two agents one of them is doing
 

2635
00:58:05,329 --> 00:58:07,059
you have two agents one of them is doing
something and the other agent says well

2636
00:58:07,059 --> 00:58:07,069
something and the other agent says well
 

2637
00:58:07,069 --> 00:58:08,230
something and the other agent says well
that's really cool I want to be able to

2638
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:08,240
that's really cool I want to be able to
 

2639
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,430
that's really cool I want to be able to
do that too and

2640
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:09,440
do that too and
 

2641
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,260
do that too and
you go and do that and so I'd say that

2642
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:11,270
you go and do that and so I'd say that
 

2643
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:12,940
you go and do that and so I'd say that
this is a very important component in

2644
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:12,950
this is a very important component in
 

2645
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:16,660
this is a very important component in
terms of second every word oh you see

2646
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:16,670
terms of second every word oh you see
 

2647
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:19,000
terms of second every word oh you see
what they do you infer the reward and

2648
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:19,010
what they do you infer the reward and
 

2649
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:21,220
what they do you infer the reward and
now we have a knob which says you see

2650
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:21,230
now we have a knob which says you see
 

2651
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:22,809
now we have a knob which says you see
what they're doing now go and try to do

2652
00:58:22,809 --> 00:58:22,819
what they're doing now go and try to do
 

2653
00:58:22,819 --> 00:58:23,440
what they're doing now go and try to do
the same thing

2654
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:23,450
the same thing
 

2655
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:26,050
the same thing
let's say this this is as far as I know

2656
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:26,060
let's say this this is as far as I know
 

2657
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,910
let's say this this is as far as I know
as far as I know this is was one of the

2658
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:27,920
as far as I know this is was one of the
 

2659
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,960
as far as I know this is was one of the
important ways in which humans are quite

2660
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:31,970
important ways in which humans are quite
 

2661
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:34,510
important ways in which humans are quite
different from other animals in way

2662
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:34,520
different from other animals in way
 

2663
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:40,059
different from other animals in way
which in the like scale and scope in

2664
00:58:40,059 --> 00:58:40,069
which in the like scale and scope in
 

2665
00:58:40,069 --> 00:58:41,620
which in the like scale and scope in
which we copy the behavior of other

2666
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:41,630
which we copy the behavior of other
 

2667
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:45,040
which we copy the behavior of other
humans might ask a quick follow-up work

2668
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:45,050
humans might ask a quick follow-up work
 

2669
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:47,050
humans might ask a quick follow-up work
go for it so that's kind of obvious how

2670
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:47,060
go for it so that's kind of obvious how
 

2671
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:48,849
go for it so that's kind of obvious how
that works in the scope of competition

2672
00:58:48,849 --> 00:58:48,859
that works in the scope of competition
 

2673
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:50,230
that works in the scope of competition
but what about just sort of arbitrary

2674
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:50,240
but what about just sort of arbitrary
 

2675
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,390
but what about just sort of arbitrary
tasks like I'm in a math class for

2676
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:52,400
tasks like I'm in a math class for
 

2677
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,859
tasks like I'm in a math class for
someone and I see someone doing a

2678
00:58:53,859 --> 00:58:53,869
someone and I see someone doing a
 

2679
00:58:53,869 --> 00:58:55,599
someone and I see someone doing a
problem a particular way and I go that's

2680
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:55,609
problem a particular way and I go that's
 

2681
00:58:55,609 --> 00:58:56,740
problem a particular way and I go that's
a good strategy maybe I should try that

2682
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:56,750
a good strategy maybe I should try that
 

2683
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:58,780
a good strategy maybe I should try that
out how does that work in a sort of non

2684
00:58:58,780 --> 00:58:58,790
out how does that work in a sort of non
 

2685
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:00,940
out how does that work in a sort of non
competitive environment so I think that

2686
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:00,950
competitive environment so I think that
 

2687
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:03,099
competitive environment so I think that
this will be I think that's going to be

2688
00:59:03,099 --> 00:59:03,109
this will be I think that's going to be
 

2689
00:59:03,109 --> 00:59:05,050
this will be I think that's going to be
a little bit separate from the

2690
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:05,060
a little bit separate from the
 

2691
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:07,390
a little bit separate from the
competitive environment but it will have

2692
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:07,400
competitive environment but it will have
 

2693
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:11,740
competitive environment but it will have
to be somehow either way you know

2694
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:11,750
to be somehow either way you know
 

2695
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:14,800
to be somehow either way you know
probably baked in maybe volved into the

2696
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:14,810
probably baked in maybe volved into the
 

2697
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:17,650
probably baked in maybe volved into the
system where like if you have other

2698
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:17,660
system where like if you have other
 

2699
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:20,470
system where like if you have other
agents doing things they're generating

2700
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:20,480
agents doing things they're generating
 

2701
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,780
agents doing things they're generating
data which you observe and the only way

2702
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:22,790
data which you observe and the only way
 

2703
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:24,339
data which you observe and the only way
to truly make sense of the data that you

2704
00:59:24,339 --> 00:59:24,349
to truly make sense of the data that you
 

2705
00:59:24,349 --> 00:59:26,920
to truly make sense of the data that you
see is to infer the goal of the agent

2706
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:26,930
see is to infer the goal of the agent
 

2707
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:29,890
see is to infer the goal of the agent
the strategy their belief state that's

2708
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:29,900
the strategy their belief state that's
 

2709
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,589
the strategy their belief state that's
important also for communicating them if

2710
00:59:32,589 --> 00:59:32,599
important also for communicating them if
 

2711
00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:33,790
important also for communicating them if
you want to successfully communicate

2712
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:33,800
you want to successfully communicate
 

2713
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:34,990
you want to successfully communicate
with someone you have to keep track both

2714
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:35,000
with someone you have to keep track both
 

2715
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,609
with someone you have to keep track both
of their goal and of their belief state

2716
00:59:36,609 --> 00:59:36,619
of their goal and of their belief state
 

2717
00:59:36,619 --> 00:59:38,319
of their goal and of their belief state
instead of knowledge so I think you will

2718
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:38,329
instead of knowledge so I think you will
 

2719
00:59:38,329 --> 00:59:40,809
instead of knowledge so I think you will
find that there are many I guess

2720
00:59:40,809 --> 00:59:40,819
find that there are many I guess
 

2721
00:59:40,819 --> 00:59:44,020
find that there are many I guess
connections between understanding what

2722
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:44,030
connections between understanding what
 

2723
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:45,670
connections between understanding what
other agents are doing inferring their

2724
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:45,680
other agents are doing inferring their
 

2725
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,559
other agents are doing inferring their
goals imitating them and community

2726
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:47,569
goals imitating them and community
 

2727
00:59:47,569 --> 00:59:49,270
goals imitating them and community
successfully communicating them all

2728
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:49,280
successfully communicating them all
 

2729
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,790
successfully communicating them all
right let's give in the happy hour a big
