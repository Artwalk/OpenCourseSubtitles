add more layers it'll get smarter and
 

189
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,470
add more layers it'll get smarter and
smarter and generalize and so that's

that question but Markov model is not it
 

585
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,060
that question but Markov model is not it
is learned but it's not back propagation

00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,070
is learned but it's not back propagation
 

587
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,090
is learned but it's not back propagation
it can learn local features so it's very

588
00:13:59,090 --> 00:13:59,100
it can learn local features so it's very
 

589
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,650
it can learn local features so it's very
good for speech recognition and the

00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:05,880
80s used these Markov models that became
 

595
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,720
80s used these Markov models that became
the standard approach because it can

596
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:08,730
the standard approach because it can
 

597
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,990
the standard approach because it can
deal with local variations so the fact

598
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
deal with local variations so the fact
 

599
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,890
deal with local variations so the fact
that a vowel is stretched you can learn

600

00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,680
that a vowel is stretched you can learn
that in a Markov model it doesn't learn

long distance relationships that's
 

605
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:24,710
long distance relationships that's
handled by the hierarchy and something

606
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:24,720
handled by the hierarchy and something
 

607
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,840
handled by the hierarchy and something
we don't fully understand yet is exactly

how the neocortex creates that hierarchy
 

611
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,720
how the neocortex creates that hierarchy
but we have figured out how it can

real time on non-invasive brain scans
 

649
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,889
real time on non-invasive brain scans
so there's a current amount of evidence

biological evolution decided to increase

800
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,010
biological evolution decided to increase
 

801
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,700
biological evolution decided to increase
the neocortex further and increase the

802
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:55,710
the neocortex further and increase the
 

803
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,919
the neocortex further and increase the
size of the enclosure and basically

804
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:57,929
size of the enclosure and basically
 

805
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:00,649
size of the enclosure and basically
filled up the frontal cortex with our

806
00:19:00,649 --> 00:19:00,659
filled up the frontal cortex with our
 

807
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:04,250
filled up the frontal cortex with our
big skulls with more neocortex and up

808
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:04,260
big skulls with more neocortex and up
 

809
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,440
big skulls with more neocortex and up
until recently it was felt that as I

810
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:06,450
until recently it was felt that as I
 

811
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,600
until recently it was felt that as I
said that this was the frontal cortex

812
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:08,610
said that this was the frontal cortex
 

813
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,490
said that this was the frontal cortex
was different because it does these

814
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:10,500
was different because it does these
 

815
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:16,880
was different because it does these
qualitatively different things but we

816
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:16,890
qualitatively different things but we
 

817
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,460
qualitatively different things but we
now realize that it's really just

818
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:19,470
now realize that it's really just
 

819
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:26,389
now realize that it's really just
additional neocortex so remember what we

820
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:26,399
additional neocortex so remember what we
 

821
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,909
additional neocortex so remember what we
did with it we're already doing a very

822
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:28,919
did with it we're already doing a very
 

823
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,529
did with it we're already doing a very
good job of being primates so we put it

824
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:30,539
good job of being primates so we put it
 

825
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:32,990
good job of being primates so we put it
at the top of the neocortical hierarchy

826
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:33,000
at the top of the neocortical hierarchy
 

827
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,450
at the top of the neocortical hierarchy
and we increased the size of the

828
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:35,460
and we increased the size of the
 

829
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,060
and we increased the size of the
hierarchy it was maybe 20% more

830
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,070
hierarchy it was maybe 20% more
 

831
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,669
hierarchy it was maybe 20% more
neocortex but it doubled it tripled the

832
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:40,679
neocortex but it doubled it tripled the
 

833
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,529
neocortex but it doubled it tripled the
number of levels because as you go up

834
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:42,539
number of levels because as you go up
 

835
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:43,669
number of levels because as you go up
the hierarchy it's kind of like a

836
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:43,679
the hierarchy it's kind of like a
 

837
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,770
the hierarchy it's kind of like a
pyramid there's fewer and fewer modules

838
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:46,780
pyramid there's fewer and fewer modules
 

839
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,310
pyramid there's fewer and fewer modules
and that was the enabling factor for us

840
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,320
and that was the enabling factor for us
 

841
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,320
and that was the enabling factor for us

00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:16,859
animal has that if you look at a chimp
and see it looks like they have a

00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:16,869
and see it looks like they have a
 

861
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:18,119

down here doesn't work very well if you

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:20,169
down here doesn't work very well if you
 

865
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:23,009
down here doesn't work very well if you
watch them trying to grab a stick so we

866
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:23,019
watch them trying to grab a stick so we
 

867
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:26,190
watch them trying to grab a stick so we
could imagine creative solutions yeah I

868
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:26,200
could imagine creative solutions yeah I
 

869
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,949
could imagine creative solutions yeah I
could take that branch and strip off the

870
00:20:28,949 --> 00:20:28,959
could take that branch and strip off the
 

871
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:31,139
could take that branch and strip off the
leaves and put a point on it and we

872
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:31,149
leaves and put a point on it and we
 

873
00:20:31,149 --> 00:20:34,769
leaves and put a point on it and we
could actually carry out these ideas and

874
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:34,779
could actually carry out these ideas and
 

875
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:37,079
could actually carry out these ideas and
create tools and then use tools to

876
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:37,089
create tools and then use tools to
 

877
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:38,969
create tools and then use tools to
create new tools and it started a whole

so Larry Page read my book in 2012 and

886
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:51,820
so Larry Page read my book in 2012 and
 

887
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,879
so Larry Page read my book in 2012 and
liked it so I met with him in Essen for

888
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:53,889
liked it so I met with him in Essen for
 

889
00:20:53,889 --> 00:20:56,969
liked it so I met with him in Essen for
an investment in a company I'd started

890
00:20:56,969 --> 00:20:56,979
an investment in a company I'd started
 

891
00:20:56,979 --> 00:21:00,060
an investment in a company I'd started
actually a couple weeks earlier to

00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,739
actually a couple weeks earlier to
develop those ideas commercially because

894
00:21:01,739 --> 00:21:01,749
develop those ideas commercially because
 

895
00:21:01,749 --> 00:21:03,289
develop those ideas commercially because
that's how I went about things as a

00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:03,299
that's how I went about things as a
 

897
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:06,620
that's how I went about things as a
serial entrepreneur

serial entrepreneur
 

899
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,720

and said well we'll invest but let me

900
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:08,730
and said well we'll invest but let me
 

901
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,100

00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:22,909
really describe how to go about it but
 

955
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:25,549
really describe how to go about it but
if it's a valid Turing test meaning it's

956
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:25,559
if it's a valid Turing test meaning it's
 

957
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,240
if it's a valid Turing test meaning it's
really convincing you through an

958
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,250
really convincing you through an
 

959
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:32,570
really convincing you through an
interrogation and dialogue that it's a

960
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:32,580
interrogation and dialogue that it's a
 

961
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,330
interrogation and dialogue that it's a
human that requires a full range of

962

human that requires a full range of
 

963
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,049
human that requires a full range of
human intelligence and I think that test

964
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:39,059
human intelligence and I think that test
 

965
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:42,680
human intelligence and I think that test
has to the test of time we're making

has to the test of time we're making
 

967
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,630
has to the test of time we're making
very good progress on that I mean just

968
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:44,640
very good progress on that I mean just

got a team of about 45 people and we've
 

1039

got a team of about 45 people and we've
been developing this hierarchical model

been developing this hierarchical model

00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:26,450
been developing this hierarchical model
we don't use Markov models because we

1042
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:26,460
we don't use Markov models because we
 

1043
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,320
we don't use Markov models because we
can use deep learning for each module

1044
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:29,330
can use deep learning for each module
 

1045
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,820
can use deep learning for each module
and so we create an embedding for each

1046
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:31,830
and so we create an embedding for each
 

1047
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,249
and so we create an embedding for each
word and we create an embedding for each

that's called Smart reply there are
simple suggestions but it has to

simple suggestions but it has to
 

1067

simple suggestions but it has to
actually understand perhaps a

on point that's for my team using this
 

1075
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,900
on point that's for my team using this
kind of hierarchical model so instead of

1076
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:12,910
kind of hierarchical model so instead of
 

1077
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:15,920
kind of hierarchical model so instead of
Markov models that uses embeddings

1078

Markov models that uses embeddings
 

1079

because we can use back propagation we

1080
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:19,270
because we can use back propagation we
 

1081
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:22,260
because we can use back propagation we
might as well use it but I think what's

1082
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:22,270
might as well use it but I think what's
 

1083
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,920
might as well use it but I think what's
missing from deep learning is this

1084
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:25,930
missing from deep learning is this
 

1085
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:29,130
missing from deep learning is this

00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,549
don't have a billion example if you
suddenly have billions of examples of

language but they're not annotated and
 

1117
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,419

how would you annotate it anyway with

how would you annotate it anyway with
 

1119
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:09,980
how would you annotate it anyway with
more language that we can't understand

more language that we can't understand
 

1121
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,330
more language that we can't understand
in the first place so that's kind of a

in the first place so that's kind of a
 

1123
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:15,499
in the first place so that's kind of a

chicken and an egg problem so I believe
 

1125
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:17,029
chicken and an egg problem so I believe

1268
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:36,950
so you mentioned both neural neural
 

1269
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,760
so you mentioned both neural neural
network models and symbolic models and I

1270
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:39,770
network models and symbolic models and I
 

1271
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:42,370
network models and symbolic models and I
was wondering how far have you been

1272
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:42,380
was wondering how far have you been
 

1273
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,020
was wondering how far have you been
thinking about combining these two

1274
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,030
thinking about combining these two
 

1275
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,200
thinking about combining these two
approaches creating a symbiosis between

1276
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,210
approaches creating a symbiosis between
 

1277
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:51,490
approaches creating a symbiosis between
neural models and symbolic ones I don't

1278
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:51,500
neural models and symbolic ones I don't
 

1279
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,460
neural models and symbolic ones I don't
think we want to use symbolic models as

1280
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:54,470
think we want to use symbolic models as
 

1281
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:59,440
think we want to use symbolic models as
they've been used how many are familiar

1282
00:29:59,440 --> 00:29:59,450
they've been used how many are familiar
 

1283
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:03,120
they've been used how many are familiar
with the psych project

1284
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,130

 

1285
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:06,070

that was a very diligent effort in Texas

1286
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,080
that was a very diligent effort in Texas
 

1287
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,660
that was a very diligent effort in Texas
to define all of common-sense reasoning

1288
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:09,670
to define all of common-sense reasoning
 

1289
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:12,840
to define all of common-sense reasoning
and it kind of collapsed on itself and

1290
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:12,850
and it kind of collapsed on itself and
 

1291
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:16,990
and it kind of collapsed on itself and
became impossible to debug because you

1292
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:17,000
became impossible to debug because you
 

1293
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,640
became impossible to debug because you
fix one thing and it break three other

1294
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:18,650
fix one thing and it break three other
 

1295
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,970
fix one thing and it break three other
things that complexity ceiling has

1296
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:21,980
things that complexity ceiling has
 

1297
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:26,620
things that complexity ceiling has
become typical of of trying to define

1298
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:26,630
become typical of of trying to define
 

1299
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:31,570
become typical of of trying to define
things through logical rules now it does

1300
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:31,580
things through logical rules now it does
 

1301
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,700
things through logical rules now it does
seem that humans can understand logical

1302
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:33,710
seem that humans can understand logical
 

1303
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,620
seem that humans can understand logical
rules we have logical rules written down

1304
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:35,630
rules we have logical rules written down
 

1305
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:40,270
rules we have logical rules written down
for things like law and game playing and

1306
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:40,280
for things like law and game playing and
 

1307
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,160
for things like law and game playing and
so on but you can actually define a

1308
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,170
so on but you can actually define a
 

1309
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:48,810
so on but you can actually define a
connectionist system to have such a high

1310
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:48,820
connectionist system to have such a high
 

1311
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:52,960
connectionist system to have such a high
reliability on a certain type of action

1312
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:52,970
reliability on a certain type of action
 

1313
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:55,480
reliability on a certain type of action
that it looks like it's a symbolic rule

1314
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:55,490
that it looks like it's a symbolic rule
 

1315
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:58,690
that it looks like it's a symbolic rule
even though it's represented in a

1316
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:58,700
even though it's represented in a
 

1317
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,930
even though it's represented in a
connectionist way and connection systems

1318
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:01,940
connectionist way and connection systems
 

1319
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:05,530
connectionist way and connection systems
can both capture the soft edges because

1320
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:05,540
can both capture the soft edges because
 

1321
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:08,320
can both capture the soft edges because
many things in life are not sharply

1322
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:08,330
many things in life are not sharply
 

1323
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,540
many things in life are not sharply
defined they can also generate

1324
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:10,550
defined they can also generate
 

1325
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:13,390
defined they can also generate
exceptions so you you don't want to

1326
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:13,400
exceptions so you you don't want to
 

1327
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,670
exceptions so you you don't want to
sacrifice your queen in chess accept

1328
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:15,680
sacrifice your queen in chess accept
 

1329
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,500
sacrifice your queen in chess accept
certain situations that might be a good

1330
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:17,510
certain situations that might be a good
 

1331
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:20,170
certain situations that might be a good
idea so you can capture that kind of

1332
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:20,180
idea so you can capture that kind of
 

1333
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:24,730
idea so you can capture that kind of
complexity so we do want to be able to

1334
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:24,740
complexity so we do want to be able to
 

1335
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:28,030
complexity so we do want to be able to
learn from accumulated human wisdom that

1336
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:28,040
learn from accumulated human wisdom that
 

1337
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,120
learn from accumulated human wisdom that
looks like it's symbolic but I think

1338
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:31,130
looks like it's symbolic but I think
 

1339
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,400
looks like it's symbolic but I think
we'll do it with a connection system but

1340
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:33,410
we'll do it with a connection system but
 

1341
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:36,880
we'll do it with a connection system but
again I'm think the connection systems

1342
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:36,890
again I'm think the connection systems
 

1343
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:40,780
again I'm think the connection systems
should develop a sense of hierarchy and

1344
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:40,790
should develop a sense of hierarchy and
 

1345
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:43,980
should develop a sense of hierarchy and
not just be one big massive neural net

1346
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:43,990
not just be one big massive neural net
 

1347
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:47,500
not just be one big massive neural net
so I understand how we want you know use

1348
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:47,510
so I understand how we want you know use
 

1349
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:50,620
so I understand how we want you know use
the neocortex to extract useful stuff

1350
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:50,630
the neocortex to extract useful stuff
 

1351
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,970
the neocortex to extract useful stuff
and commercialize that but I'm wondering

1352
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:51,980
and commercialize that but I'm wondering
 

1353
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,210
and commercialize that but I'm wondering
how you know our middle brain and organs

1354
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:55,220
how you know our middle brain and organs
 

1355
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,280
how you know our middle brain and organs
that are below the neocortex will be

1356
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:57,290
that are below the neocortex will be
 

1357
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:01,210
that are below the neocortex will be
useful for you know turn that into what

1358
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:01,220
useful for you know turn that into what
 

1359
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,610
useful for you know turn that into what
you want to do something well the

1360
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:03,620
you want to do something well the
 

1361
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,440
you want to do something well the
cerebellum is an interesting case in

1362
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:05,450
cerebellum is an interesting case in
 

1363
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:08,320
cerebellum is an interesting case in
point it actually has more neurons than

1364
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:08,330
point it actually has more neurons than
 

1365
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:12,490
point it actually has more neurons than
the neocortex and it's used to

1366
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:12,500
the neocortex and it's used to
 

1367
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,510
the neocortex and it's used to
govern most of our behavior some things

1368
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:16,520
govern most of our behavior some things
 

1369
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,669
govern most of our behavior some things
if you write a signature that's actually

1370
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:18,679
if you write a signature that's actually
 

1371
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:21,399
if you write a signature that's actually
controlled by the cerebellum so a simple

1372
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:21,409
controlled by the cerebellum so a simple
 

1373
00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:26,140
controlled by the cerebellum so a simple
sequence is stored in the cerebellum but

1374
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:26,150
sequence is stored in the cerebellum but
 

1375
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,419
sequence is stored in the cerebellum but
there's not many reasoning to it it's

1376
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:28,429
there's not many reasoning to it it's
 

1377
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:32,580
there's not many reasoning to it it's
basically a script and most of our

1378
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:32,590
basically a script and most of our
 

1379
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:35,320
basically a script and most of our
movement now has actually been migrated

1380
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:35,330
movement now has actually been migrated
 

1381
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,470
movement now has actually been migrated
from the center vellum to the neocortex

1382
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:37,480
from the center vellum to the neocortex
 

1383
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,080
from the center vellum to the neocortex
cerebellum is still there some people

1384
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,090
cerebellum is still there some people
 

1385
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,899
cerebellum is still there some people
the entire cerebellum is destroyed

1386
00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:43,909
the entire cerebellum is destroyed
 

1387
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:46,419
the entire cerebellum is destroyed
through disease they still function

1388
00:32:46,419 --> 00:32:46,429
through disease they still function
 

1389
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:49,270
through disease they still function
fairly normally their movement might be

1390
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:49,280
fairly normally their movement might be
 

1391
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,330
fairly normally their movement might be
a little erratic as our movements is

1392
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:52,340
a little erratic as our movements is
 

1393
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,430
a little erratic as our movements is
largely controlled by the neocortex but

1394
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:54,440
largely controlled by the neocortex but
 

1395
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,950
largely controlled by the neocortex but
some of the subtlety is a kind of

1396
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:56,960
some of the subtlety is a kind of
 

1397
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,710
some of the subtlety is a kind of
pre-programmed script and so they'll

1398
00:32:59,710 --> 00:32:59,720
pre-programmed script and so they'll
 

1399
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,600
pre-programmed script and so they'll
look a little clumsy but they're

1400
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:01,610
look a little clumsy but they're
 

1401
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:05,529
look a little clumsy but they're
actually function okay a lot of other

1402
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:05,539
actually function okay a lot of other
 

1403
00:33:05,539 --> 00:33:07,980
actually function okay a lot of other
areas of the brain control autonomic

1404
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:07,990
areas of the brain control autonomic
 

1405
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:11,560
areas of the brain control autonomic
functions like breathing and but our

1406
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:11,570
functions like breathing and but our
 

1407
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,539
functions like breathing and but our
thinking really is is controlled by the

1408
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:13,549
thinking really is is controlled by the
 

1409
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:17,520
thinking really is is controlled by the
neocortex in terms of mastering

neocortex in terms of mastering
 

1411
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:20,740
neocortex in terms of mastering
intelligence I think the neocortex is

00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:20,750
intelligence I think the neocortex is
 

1413
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:25,960

continue or will there be a whole
paradigm shift what do you predict well

1426
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:42,409
paradigm shift what do you predict well
 

1427
00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:44,380
paradigm shift what do you predict well
in the singularities near I talked about

1428
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:44,390
in the singularities near I talked about
 

1429
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,710
in the singularities near I talked about
the atomic limits based on molecular

1430
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:47,720
the atomic limits based on molecular
 

1431
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,430
the atomic limits based on molecular
computing as we understand it and it can

1432
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:51,440
computing as we understand it and it can
 

1433
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,950
computing as we understand it and it can
actually go well past 2045 and actually

1434
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:53,960
actually go well past 2045 and actually
 

1435
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,279
actually go well past 2045 and actually
go to trillions of trillions of times

1436
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:56,289
go to trillions of trillions of times
 

1437
00:33:56,289 --> 00:33:58,899
go to trillions of trillions of times
greater computational capacity than we

1438
00:33:58,899 --> 00:33:58,909
greater computational capacity than we
 

1439
00:33:58,909 --> 00:34:01,049
greater computational capacity than we
have today

1440
00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:01,059
have today
 

1441
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:04,720
have today
so I don't see that's stopping anytime

1442
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:04,730
so I don't see that's stopping anytime
 

1443
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:07,120
so I don't see that's stopping anytime
soon and we'll go you know way beyond

1444
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,130
soon and we'll go you know way beyond
 

1445
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:12,879
soon and we'll go you know way beyond
what we can imagine and it becomes an

1446
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:12,889
what we can imagine and it becomes an
 

1447
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:14,470
what we can imagine and it becomes an
interesting discussion what the impact

1448
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:14,480
interesting discussion what the impact
 

1449
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,990
interesting discussion what the impact
on human civilization will be so take it

1450
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:20,000
on human civilization will be so take it
 

1451
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,690
on human civilization will be so take it
may be slightly more mundane issue that

1452
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:22,700
may be slightly more mundane issue that
 

1453
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,180
may be slightly more mundane issue that
comes up as a kind of eliminates most

1454
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:25,190
comes up as a kind of eliminates most
 

1455
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:25,990
comes up as a kind of eliminates most
jobs or

1456
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:26,000
jobs or
 

1457
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,500
jobs or
jobs a point I make is it's not the

1458
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:29,510
jobs a point I make is it's not the
 

1459
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,240
jobs a point I make is it's not the
first time in human history you've done

1460
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:31,250
first time in human history you've done
 

1461
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:34,659
first time in human history you've done
that how many jobs circa 1900 exist

1462
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:34,669
that how many jobs circa 1900 exist
 

1463
00:34:34,669 --> 00:34:39,159
that how many jobs circa 1900 exist
today and that was the feeling of the

1464
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:39,169
today and that was the feeling of the
 

1465
00:34:39,169 --> 00:34:41,320
today and that was the feeling of the
Luddites which was an actual society

1466
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:41,330
Luddites which was an actual society
 

1467
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,810
Luddites which was an actual society
that formed in 1800 the automation of

1468
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:43,820
that formed in 1800 the automation of
 

1469
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:47,409
that formed in 1800 the automation of
the textile industry in England they

1470
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:47,419
the textile industry in England they
 

1471
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:48,820
the textile industry in England they
looked at all these jobs going away and

1472
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:48,830
looked at all these jobs going away and
 

1473
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:51,550
looked at all these jobs going away and
felt that employment is going to be just

1474
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:51,560
felt that employment is going to be just
 

1475
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,610
felt that employment is going to be just
limited to an elite indeed those jobs

1476
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:54,620
limited to an elite indeed those jobs
 

1477
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,060
limited to an elite indeed those jobs
didn't go away but new jobs were created

1478
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,070
didn't go away but new jobs were created
 

1479
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:00,490
didn't go away but new jobs were created
so if I were oppression Futures to 1900

1480
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:00,500
so if I were oppression Futures to 1900
 

1481
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,850
so if I were oppression Futures to 1900
I would say well 38% of you work on

1482
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:03,860
I would say well 38% of you work on
 

1483
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,180
I would say well 38% of you work on
farms and 25% work in factories it's 2/3

1484
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:07,190
farms and 25% work in factories it's 2/3
 

1485
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:13,330
farms and 25% work in factories it's 2/3
of the working force but I predict by

1486
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:13,340
of the working force but I predict by
 

1487
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:16,600
of the working force but I predict by
2015 115 years from now it's going to be

1488
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:16,610
2015 115 years from now it's going to be
 

1489
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:19,540
2015 115 years from now it's going to be
2% on farms and 9% factories and

1490
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:19,550
2% on farms and 9% factories and
 

1491
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,370
2% on farms and 9% factories and
everybody would go oh my God we're gonna

1492
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:21,380
everybody would go oh my God we're gonna
 

1493
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,170
everybody would go oh my God we're gonna
be out of work and I said well don't

1494
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:23,180
be out of work and I said well don't
 

1495
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,910
be out of work and I said well don't
worry for all these jobs we eliminate

1496
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:24,920
worry for all these jobs we eliminate
 

1497
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,230
worry for all these jobs we eliminate
through automation we're gonna invent

1498
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:26,240
through automation we're gonna invent
 

1499
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,290
through automation we're gonna invent
new jobs and say oh really what new jobs

1500
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:29,300
new jobs and say oh really what new jobs
 

1501
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,120
new jobs and say oh really what new jobs
and I'd say well I don't know we haven't

1502
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:31,130
and I'd say well I don't know we haven't
 

1503
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,150
and I'd say well I don't know we haven't
invented them yet that's the political

1504
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:34,160
invented them yet that's the political
 

1505
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,190
invented them yet that's the political
problem we could see jobs very clearly

1506
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:36,200
problem we could see jobs very clearly
 

1507
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,620
problem we could see jobs very clearly
going away fairly soon like driving a

1508
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:38,630
going away fairly soon like driving a
 

1509
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:42,220
going away fairly soon like driving a
car or truck and the new jobs haven't

1510
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:42,230
car or truck and the new jobs haven't
 

1511
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,510
car or truck and the new jobs haven't
been invented I mean just look at the

1512
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:43,520
been invented I mean just look at the
 

1513
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,780
been invented I mean just look at the
last five or six years as many a lot of

1514
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:46,790
last five or six years as many a lot of
 

1515
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:48,280
last five or six years as many a lot of
the increase in employment has been

1516
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:48,290
the increase in employment has been
 

1517
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:52,510
the increase in employment has been
through mobile app related types of ways

1518
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:52,520
through mobile app related types of ways
 

1519
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,280
through mobile app related types of ways
of making money that just weren't

1520
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:54,290
of making money that just weren't
 

1521
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:58,210
of making money that just weren't
contemplated even six years ago if I

1522
00:35:58,210 --> 00:35:58,220
contemplated even six years ago if I
 

1523
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,770
contemplated even six years ago if I
really prescient I would say well you're

1524
00:35:59,770 --> 00:35:59,780
really prescient I would say well you're
 

1525
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,690
really prescient I would say well you're
gonna get jobs creating mobile apps and

1526
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:01,700
gonna get jobs creating mobile apps and
 

1527
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,940
gonna get jobs creating mobile apps and
websites and doing data analytics and

1528
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:05,950
websites and doing data analytics and
 

1529
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:09,270
websites and doing data analytics and
self-driving cars cars what's a car and

1530
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:09,280
self-driving cars cars what's a car and
 

1531
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,380
self-driving cars cars what's a car and
nobody would have any idea what I'm

1532
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:11,390
nobody would have any idea what I'm
 

1533
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:16,030
nobody would have any idea what I'm
talking about now the new job

1534
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:16,040
talking about now the new job
 

1535
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,800
talking about now the new job
some people say yeah we created new jobs

1536
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:17,810
some people say yeah we created new jobs
 

1537
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:20,920
some people say yeah we created new jobs
but it's not as many actually we've gone

1538
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:20,930
but it's not as many actually we've gone
 

1539
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,950
but it's not as many actually we've gone
from 24 million jobs in nineteen hundred

1540
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:22,960
from 24 million jobs in nineteen hundred
 

1541
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,170
from 24 million jobs in nineteen hundred
242 million jobs today for 30 percent of

the population to forty five percent of
 

1545

the population to forty five percent of
the population the new jobs pay eleven

1546
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:30,800
the population the new jobs pay eleven
 

1547
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,560
the population the new jobs pay eleven
times as much in constant dollars and

1548
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:32,570
times as much in constant dollars and
 

1549
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,840
times as much in constant dollars and
they're more interesting and as I talk

1550
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:34,850
they're more interesting and as I talk
 

1551
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:37,600
they're more interesting and as I talk
to people starting out their career now

1552
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:37,610
to people starting out their career now
 

1553
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,190
to people starting out their career now
they really want a career that gives

1554
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:39,200
they really want a career that gives
 

1555
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:39,740
they really want a career that gives
them some

1556
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:39,750
them some
 

1557
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,530
them some
life definition and purpose and

1558
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:42,540
life definition and purpose and
 

1559
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,630
life definition and purpose and
gratification we're moving up Maslow's

1560
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:44,640
gratification we're moving up Maslow's
 

1561
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,930
gratification we're moving up Maslow's
hierarchy hundred years ago you were

1562
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:47,940
hierarchy hundred years ago you were
 

1563
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,400
hierarchy hundred years ago you were
happy if you had a back-breaking job to

1564
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:49,410
happy if you had a back-breaking job to
 

1565
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:52,810
happy if you had a back-breaking job to
put food on your family's table so and

1566
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:52,820
put food on your family's table so and
 

1567
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,810
put food on your family's table so and
we couldn't do these new jobs without

1568
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:55,820
we couldn't do these new jobs without
 

1569
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,070
we couldn't do these new jobs without
enhancing our intelligence so we've been

1570
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:58,080
enhancing our intelligence so we've been
 

1571
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,190
enhancing our intelligence so we've been
doing that well for most of the last 100

1572
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:01,200
doing that well for most of the last 100
 

1573
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,470
doing that well for most of the last 100
years through education we've expanded

1574
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:03,480
years through education we've expanded
 

1575
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,360
years through education we've expanded
to K through 12 and constant dollars

1733
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:40,250
gave a couple of speeches and lectures
on the relationship of human society to

on the relationship of human society to
 

1735
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,920
on the relationship of human society to
technology and he particularly

1736
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:42,930
technology and he particularly
 

1737
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,570
technology and he particularly
distinguished between the mode of

reflective thinking or meditative
 

1745
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,090
reflective thinking or meditative
thinking and he posed this question what

1746
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:54,100
thinking and he posed this question what
 

1747
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,420
thinking and he posed this question what
is the the meaning and purpose of

1748
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:56,430
is the the meaning and purpose of
 

1749
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:58,770
is the the meaning and purpose of
technological development and he

1750
00:40:58,770 --> 00:40:58,780
technological development and he
 

1751
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,510
technological development and he
couldn't find an answer he he

1752
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:00,520
couldn't find an answer he he
 

1753
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,120
couldn't find an answer he he
recommended to remain open to what he

1754
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:03,130
recommended to remain open to what he
 

1755
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,850
recommended to remain open to what he
called and he called this an openness to

1756
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:05,860
called and he called this an openness to
 

1757
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,250
called and he called this an openness to
the mystery I wonder whether you have

1758
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:08,260
the mystery I wonder whether you have
 

1759
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,500
the mystery I wonder whether you have
any thoughts on this is there is there a

1760
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:10,510
any thoughts on this is there is there a
 

1761
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,090
any thoughts on this is there is there a
meaning of purpose to technological

1762

meaning of purpose to technological
 

1763
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,000

power of our muscles with machines
 

1777

00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:03,720
we see basically exponential growth from
 

2203
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,180
we see basically exponential growth from
each innovation

2204
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:07,190

 

2205
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:09,550

so and we certainly see that in deep

2206
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:09,560
so and we certainly see that in deep
 

2207
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,580
so and we certainly see that in deep
learning the architectures are getting

2208
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:12,590
learning the architectures are getting
 

2209
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:13,180
learning the architectures are getting
better

2210
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:13,190
better
 

2211
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:15,190
better
while we also have more data and more

2212
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:15,200
while we also have more data and more
 

2213
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,320
while we also have more data and more
computation and more memory to throw in

2214
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:17,330
computation and more memory to throw in
 

2215
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:25,790
computation and more memory to throw in
these at these algorithms

2216
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:25,800

 

2217
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,580

thank you for being
